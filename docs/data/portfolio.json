The main stage area was fantastic! Multiple large screens and cameras that displayed the speakers made it very easy to follow the presenters which kept me fully engaged in the content instead of trying to see the stage.",

The only down side would be our hallway 7th floor, was messy. Maybe they missed vacuuming the floor, lots of small garbage everywhere.  The lobby bathroom could also use some attention. At a high-end hotel I would expect the management to have attention to detail. Overall good experience though.",

I had to make four trips to unload my car. walking down those long, narrow corridors with a bunch of stuff which was very heavy. \nWhenever you book this hotel, the staff should send a detailed map to show you what the best place to park is and what's the best way to get to your room, or else you will find yourself questioning your sanity. \nThe two-room suite was nice. Too bad I needed GPS to find it.",

It's the perfect place if you just need a night to stay and don't need the frills of a bigger hotel.  It's in a safe area near a few restaurants. In our room we smelled smoke whenever someone was outside smoking, but not sure if it was due to our patio door not having a good seal once closed, or if it came through the air conditioner/heater.  Overall, it's small, quaint, nice people at the front desk, and perfect for a quick stay. \n\n",

Jesse and Natalie graciously helped us out, and then again later, for desert. Their kindness, warmth, and compassion truly helped to turn around a stressful and challenging situation.

They demand an itinerary number, which is never provided, even on the statement. They provide a reservation # & folio # but no itinerary number. Both numbers I called were answered by AI with no option to get a person. When you push \"0\", AI hangs up on you. The receipt they provided didn't explain the extra $150 charge that is on my credit card. In addition, this suburban location with a huge, empty parking lot has decided to start charing for parking. Hate to be yanked around in AI merry-go-round hell and to be nickled and dimed. Typical corporate BS - do everything yourself online or on your phone and if you have a problem, too bad. We are simply here to take your money. This old hotel with small rooms isn't worth the AI aggravation that dealing with Marriott has apparently adopted as their customer service model.",

The staff were very communicative and accommodating, making sure our requests were met with ease.\n\nWe chose this hotel to be close to family for a wedding, and it turned out to be a great decision. Check-in was smooth, and we were promptly given a room upon arrival. A few hours later, however, I noticed the room felt like it was lightly shaking (we are unsure why), which unsettled both me and my infant. When I requested a room change, the staff responded quickly and moved us without hesitation. Both rooms were spacious, and I especially appreciated the little study nook in the room, which I made good use of.\n\nSince our stay was only two nights, I can’t comment much on housekeeping—we declined service when it was offered—but overall, it was a very good experience.",

Overall acceptable, but nothing to get excited about. Breakfast served only until 9 a.m. on weekdays and 9:30 on weekends. Coffee was not very good, when it was available.

Although the rooms and common areas were clean the refrigerator in the room smelled bad and the public toilet needed more attention as the waste basket there was not emptied for a couple of days.\n\nThe other item we found very uncomfortable is that the bathroom is located in the middle of the room across from the beds and it has a glass door.  Although it is  opaque if one uses the bathroom in the middle of the night the entire room lights up.  The bathroom has a pocket door and  it makes a lot of noise when you open and close it and, of course, it does not provide total privacy.  So overall no good sleeping quality if you are not traveling solo.\n\nThe breakfast bar has enough selection for this type of hotel, but the quality of the items was kind of low.  For example, the muffins were halfway frozen, the coffee was pretty bad under any standards.\n\nThe staff overall was nice but inefficient for the most part.  It took two days and speaking to two different people to repair the broken pocket door in the bathroom in our room.",

The only negative is that room 435 backs up to the laundry so you can feel the bed shake due to the machines. Apparently they do laundry 24 hours. lol It was walking distance to shopping and dining which was very convenient.",

We liked the location with lots of shopping and dining options nearby.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  Customer service was great.  We spoke to three different people at the front desk and they were all very helpful.  They provide free parking, free Wi-Fi and complimentary breakfast.  We recommend staying at Springhill Suites for a comfortable stay.",

          "text": "Stopped by the Springhill Suites for an evening.  Great place to stay.\nWhat we noticed when we entered the lobby was the cleanliness and lack of odors.  I don't have pets in my house, and don't like to stay in places that accommodates pets.  There were no funky pet odors in this place. We talked to the staff and they said they don't allow them.\n\nRoom was clean and odor free.  The room we had was furnished with 2 queen beds and a sofa the made into a bed.  The beds were comfortable.  We were in a party of 4, so I ended up on the couch.  I slept very well.  The room had a desk area that separated the beds from the sofa/ sitting area.  Great place to work.  I was up until about 2AM working on some things for work.  The folks in the room never knew that I was working; there is a sliding partition between the beds and the desk, so I shut that and kept on working.\n\nA couple of preferences.  The bathroom has a sliding door, with a milk glass insert.  Great for staying alone or with a significant other, but not so good when staying with friends.  A little uncomfortable.  \n\nThe second is the food/ beverage service.  For breakfast there was a selection of cereals, yogurt, waffles, etc.  The quiche was undercooked and not pleasant.  The meats were either a turkey sausage or something like that but not pork.  There were bagels with egg and some type of meat were prepackaged and reheated, we couldn't do those either.  On the positive side, the juice dispenser was open all night and the tea/ coffee bar was stocked.  However, there was no hot water after a certain hour. \n\nThe big thing for me is the cleanliness and service.  The SpringHill Suites at this location knocked that one out of the park for me.",

We initially booked an Airbnb for our week long Chicago Christmas but decided last minute to book a hotel with a pool, and in/out privilege parking. Of course, the pool was out of order our entire week almost, it was fixed before we left but the water was so cold we couldn’t enjoy it. Regardless we had fun running around the hotel with our 3 year old, he loved the fountain, and big perk was free breakfast! It was great. Alternated between pancakes and French toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, made to order omelets! Honestly big spread, toast, bagels, muffins, yogurt, fruit, oatmeal, something for everyone! They also had 2 free drinks (alcohol or not) we day from 5:30 pm with light snacks) honestly, totally great for families which we saw many of. It felt like home, everyone in their PJs for breakfast - some families took it to their room and others tried to find a table which sometimes wasn’t easy but we always managed to find one. We met the best cleaning lady, she was super sweet and memorable on floor 4. Location wise, amazing, surrounded by many top restaurants, shopping and attractions. Rooms are big and spacious, fun space for families traveling together with kids. We really enjoyed our stay! Also valet team was great also! :)",

          "text": "Overall the hotel was wonderful. The location was great as it was a busy area, felt safe, and was close to all the key spots in the Loop. The room was very spacious and clean. Lobby was very bright and you felt like you were on vacation. Breakfast area was very spacious so if you wanted a bit of privacy, you could. Plenty of elevators so didn't need to wait long as is the case in some other hotels. A couple of late night supermarkets very close by in case of a need for a late night snack, etc. The service counter was a bit slow, but it was right before Christmas as well as before a Chicago Blackhawks game so perhaps more chaotic than usual with numbers of guests, etc. Overall, a really good experience! Would definitely stay there again.",

No tickets or wrist bands are needed for breakfast,  the pool is small, but rooms are spacious and it was an overall welcoming environment.  We got a puppy for Christmas and this was our first time visiting a pet friendly hotel and the experience was great! I booked 2 rooms, one for my husband and ai, the othet for the kids. This was a perfect staycation.😍",

This was around 2-3am. You'll get it when you get in. Not bad enough where we wouldnt want to stay here again.\nParking was also a breeze! Overnight valet is $80 so keep that in mind.",

Very busy hotel for good reason, the breakfast was well organized and thought out… get there early! Everyone was raving over their selections and quality over the food. Room was mostly clean, although I saw some of the fixtures and bathroom amenities need to be replaced or cleaned more thoroughly. The beds make you feel like you’re sinking into a ‘giant pillow’ in a comfortable relaxing way. The gym was quite small regarding the size of this humongous hotel so there is little to no space. Overall would definitely book again!",

          "text": "I had an extremely unsettling and disappointing stay at this Embassy Suites. From the moment we arrived, the hotel felt unsafe and completely out of control.\n\nThere was unrestricted access to the elevators and guest room floors, with no keycard enforcement at all. As a result, several groups booked rooms and then hosted large parties for people who were not hotel guests. Many of these attendees were clearly underage and were openly drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana, and blasting loud music late into the night. Hallways were chaotic and intimidating. It reached the point where the police had to be called, and multiple people were arrested. That alone should tell you how badly this property is being managed.\n\nThe overall atmosphere felt more like a ghetto than a hotel that is supposed to represent the Embassy Suites brand. We never felt comfortable or secure during our stay.\n\nTo make matters worse, one entire bank of elevators was out of service. This caused extremely long waits just to get to our room, adding even more frustration to an already miserable experience.\n\nAnd despite all of this, the hotel had the audacity to charge a $25 per day “destination fee.” For what exactly? Broken elevators, unsafe conditions, and police activity in the hallways?\n\nThis was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. Poor security, poor management, and zero accountability. I would strongly advise anyone to stay elsewhere unless you enjoy chaos, noise, and feeling unsafe during your trip.",

The Embassy Suites Magnificent Mile had an easy check in process with Jay, and when the room we were initially assigned was not ready, it was quickly switched to another room.  It's nice to have two rooms if traveling with kids to make a bigger space.  The room was clean and well appointed.  We appreciated the two tvs and the easy to connect to internet.  The breakfast buffet was well run and efficient.  We did not do the omelet station, but it was very popular.  Currently an elevator bank is being worked on in the hotel, but waits were never very bad--don't let that discourage you. I liked that the front desk will text you and respond to any questions during your stay.  We also stopped by the small gift shop for gum, and it was nice not to go out into the cold.  When it was time to leave, the Bellhop was able to get us a cab to the airport in about a minute.   I'd definitely recommend the Embassy Suites to anyone visiting the downtown area.",

Our room was a lot bigger than I had expected. Having the extra suite room allowed us the ability to go to sleep and not bother the other person or get up in the morning and go out in the other room and watch TV. The value was higher than other area hotels for the reasons above. \n\nAlso, we experienced great service from a lady from HGV by the name of Erin.  Not only did she answer all our questions but she anticipated many others that we had not considered. Her recommendations on places to go and where to eat were perfect for us. Finally, her personality was fantastic…we felt we were interacting with a lifelong friend, although we had just met her.",

The hotel is in a fantastic location, close to restaurants and stores, making it easy to walk and explore the city. The room was clean, comfortable, and well-maintained, though ours was located right by the elevator, so we did notice the noise whenever it moved. What really stood out, however, was the breakfast experience. The buffet is made-to-order, and Sergio, the staff member taking orders, was incredibly personable and attentive. When I ordered an omelet with no meat, he quickly noticed I didn’t eat pork and thoughtfully offered turkey sausage on the side—small gestures like that made a big impression. Despite the elevator noise, the staff, amenities, and overall experience make this hotel a place we’d gladly return to; this was actually our second or third stay here.",

The rooms are a little dated, but very comfortable, clean and well appointed. My room had a view of the shopping area and lake and was very quiet. The fitness center is clean and well appointed. The biggest surprise was how good the food was. I only ate breakfast over my two day stay but each entree was incredibly delicious and the menu had so many options. The service - from front desk to restaurant staff to security and bellmen - was exceptional. Every team member is friendly and welcoming. I look forward to returning!",

He asked us what kind of restaurant we were looking for and then circled those that would be a good match for us. We were only there one night but the next morning it was Sajag who would once again be a friendly face, ready to help us with any questions we had.",

I had a freaky accident of dropping phone in the elevator shaft (yes, it can happen so secure your phone before getting on an elevator!) and the whole staff went above and beyond to retrieve the phone and had it delivered to my office next morning. Special shout out to Desmond! I visit the area frequently and always stay at this hotel for the service.",

          "text": "I examined all the Marriott properties in the DC area several times and chose to stay at this property for 4 days.  I made the right decision.  I recommend upgrading to a King Suite.  It was very spacious and clean and comfortable.   The couch in the living room may be uncomfortable for a tall person but I'm short so it was fine. The parking is different, you have to park across the street at a garage.  I was worried because I had a lot of stuff to take to my room (I tend to overpack and buy too much at the grocery store for my stay) but there was a space in the 15-minute parking in front of the hotel and there was a luggage cart, so it was pretty easy unloading.  The parking is free which is getting pretty rare these days with Marriott properties.  The garage does get hectic on a Saturday night, but you just have to be patient.  It felt like an oasis when I stepped in the Courtyard, so peaceful compared to the streets outside.  I will definitely be returning to this hotel!  One thing which was annoying was I like to do my laundry early on a Monday, but no one had emptied the coins from the machines, so they were inoperable, so I had to go to a laundromat 5 miles away.  You would think they'd be emptied on Sunday evening.  Also, I was charged $160 extra but it was taken care of the day I mentioned it.  Overall, I had a great stay here!!",

I can’t comment on the food… And there is a mini Starbucks in the actual establishment but for titanium members there are no benefits except getting your basic or whatever they give us… and even when I question the new front desk people about the water, they said free water is coming in July… I was like OK July is in two days… Can you take the water out of my tab and the answer was no :-) \n\nIs that Marriott customer service?!? No benefits at all.",

Very nice staff especially at the FD. \n\n3.  Clean.\n\n4.  As a Platinum, preassigned me a nice view. Also had 10$ credit each day.\n\n5. Free parking across the street.\n\n6. Starbucks brewed drinks for sale.\n\nCons-\n1. One elevator was scary. This elevator had no lights (used phone flashlight)  and the buttons did not work Saturday morning. You just ride it and hope the door opened on the the floor you wanted. No one closed it down so people were riding up and down. This one elevator really needed to be turned off for safety. An elderly woman asked me not to get off and ride with her as she was so scared. \n\n2. This may sound trivial but caused me a headache. I ordered  a wake up call and it was never actioned on. I didn’t wake up as intended and missed most of the group breakfast and had 13 minutes to get dressed for a wedding to make it in time to the shuttles. Not a good start and didn’t look good for the wedding.\n\nThe next  day I called the FD and asked them please to not forget and they told me they don’t take wake up calls and I need to program it myself on the phone. Why did the gentleman the night before not tell me that?\n\nThe FD was kind and offered a courtesy point service recovery  but that never happened. I had to email Marriott to get the points. Mistakes happen.",

It was late, I was tired, I guessed the elevator usage would drop off. What an idiot I was. I slept from 1 until 4am and then tries to drown out the noise with my own ear plugs, then by listening to music on my iPhone earbuds. I gave up just after 5am and changed rooms from a large suite to a twin.

My sister has status at Marriott and we really were not expecting much from an airport hotel. We were completely surprised at how clean everything was. More importantly, our experience with Bailee, at the front desk, who checked us in, was the highlight of our trip. She was personable, professional, funny, and just so welcoming. It was as if we had known her forever, and we felt so taken care of by her. She is absolutely a huge credit to Marriott and they knew exactly what they were doing by hiring her!\n\nThe restaurant “Flight Burger” was delicious and cooked exactly to order. Don’t miss out on the wedge salad with blue cheese dressing!\n\nThe room is a standard Marriott room with the beds and pillows being incredibly comfortable as always. Jorge brought us an additional comforter and was so kind in searching for what we needed.\n\nWe would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it especially for ease of location to the airport.",

I’ve stayed at many many Marriott properties, some also have good teams, and I’ve seen some really overworked and unhappy teams. But so far, of all the properties we have stayed at, this team is at the top. Congratulations on creating such great energy.",

The service was excellent, and the atmosphere was genuinely friendly. Every team member made me feel welcome at all times, which is exactly what one expects from a fine hotel.\n\nI would especially like to extend a sincere thank you to Yessenia, Nabil, Emery, Emerita, Marta, Salomon, Siali, and Dinora for their true professionalism and engaging conversation. Their dedication and positive attitude made my stay particularly enjoyable.\n\nPlease share this note with your management team and the individuals mentioned above, as their efforts truly reflect the high standards of the Marriott brand.\n\nSincerely,\nLewis Durham\nLifetime Titanium Member / Ambassador",

          "text": "I stayed at the Houston Airport Marriott only because I had to. My United flight was canceled, and I needed a place to stay for an early morning flight. The only real benefit of this hotel is convenience. You don’t have to leave the airport, which is helpful when flights are disrupted.\n\nThat said, I was absolutely shocked by the price. This hotel charges what feels like a resort rate for a property that is not a resort in any way. It’s a very standard airport hotel. It is nothing special, nothing elevated, and certainly nothing luxurious. Ironically, I recently stayed at a true resort in Scottsdale, Arizona for the same price, and that property was a genuine 10-star experience in every sense.\n\nFor what you’re paying here, the value just isn’t there. You’re essentially paying a premium solely for location, not amenities, not atmosphere, and not experience. Marriott really needs to reconsider and lower the pricing for this property to better reflect what it actually offers.\n\nConvenient? Yes.\nWorth the price? Absolutely not.",

To my dismay, the hotel had been sold out the night before and I was told I would be unable to check in early to rest in between flights. Luckily for me, I genuinely caring front desk. Staff member went the extra mile, noticed I was sitting nearby, attempting to find other hotels, and took the time to talk to a manager. Between them, I was able to get into a room coming off a red eye, and knowing I could sleep in between flights versus sitting for six hours was the best news I had heard that day thank you Rosario for going the extra mile and a world where people do just enough, and never more, your gesture is appreciated.",

We arrived early, and we were traveling with a family friend, who is 82 years old. Monique went above and beyond to make our experience memorable. She got information on wheelchair assistance for our friend, who was flying the next day. She was able to find us rooms for very early check in. She even took time to walk us over to the M. Club lounge. She was friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and most of all made us feel like she was really happy we were there. This is such a refreshing difference from so many hotels where you are made to feel like you are an inconvenience. \n\nWhile Monique was above and beyond, I also want to mention, that the overall service was very good. When we pulled up there was someone eager to assist with all our bags, when I was in the elevator, another member of the staff happily explained the color coding of their hallways. I travel a lot internationally, and this kind of truly friendly, helpful service is common in places I stayed in Asia, but is so rare in the US. \n\nThe location is extremely convenient. The beds and bedding are comfortable. Room decor is modern and in good taste. The bath is well laid out. \n\nBreakfast in the M Club was impressive, including a wide range of fresh fruits, biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, sausage, danish, etc.\n\nOverall, truly impressed with this hotel. We selected it because of the location, but found it to be a rare gem in terms of quality. Whoever manages this location is deserving of a promotion as I am Titanium with Marriott Bonvoy (lifetime Platinum), so I stay at Marriott properties often, but this one stands far above most. A big thank you for everyone on staff, who turned the necessity of a stay near the airport into something memorable.",

Rooms are clean and beds are comfortable.  Ticks all the boxes for me.",

She instantly made us feel like a valued  Marriott member (I am Gold, so not super high status). She was prompt checking us in making sure we knew where our room was and how to get to it. She even topped things off by leaving a handwritten note on our door as she overheard our conversation about recently celebrating our anniversary. Really made us feel special.  \n\nIn this world courtesy and kindness seem to be disappearing. This young lady really is the embodiment of what everyone who deals in customer service should be! \n\nI’ll also mention the serving staff in the restaurant for the morning buffet. Carlos (chef) was also very welcoming, kind and seemed genuinely interested in making sure our food was fresh, hot and tasty. The rest of the staff was smiling and  welcoming as well.  \n\nWe have frequented this hotel for years. Service has never been better. This speaks loudly for whomever is managing this property. Great team!",

          "text": "My family chose this hotel because it was the most wheelchair accessible option we could find in Waikiki. The accessible room is big, with ample space in the bathroom, grab bars in the shower and by the toilet, and a folded shower seat. The only issues in the room is that the bathroom sink is a little high for someone in a wheelchair and opening the door to get out of the room would be hard without help. We didn't use the pool or pool lift, mostly because the angle of the buildings meant the pool itself never got any direct sunlight (although the deck did, depending on the time).\n\nThe beds are comfortable, although definitely on the softer side. The breakfast buffet was okay, but not great. It usually had some type of egg (scrambled, breakfast sandwich), bread & bagels, yogurt & granola, juices, and fruit (typically apples, pineapple, or banana), and occasionally sausage, bacon, or waffles. There's filtered water stations in the lobby, which was really handy and you get a bottle of water upon check-in to use throughout your stay.\n\nThe gym has a small weight rack, a cable machine, treadmills, bikes, and one peloton bike. The beach is a short walk away and I preferred being on the farther end of Waikiki where it's not quite as busy with crowds. Everything is very walkable and there's good food and coffee options nearby. The staff at the hotel are really great and were very accommodating and helpful with our requests and accessibility needs. Would definitely recommend for anyone in a wheelchair or mobility issues.",

          "text": "I booked this hotel through Expedia, and honestly, I feel that neither the photos nor the reviews can be fully trusted. The room I was given was very different from what was shown in the pictures. When I spoke to the front desk and explained that I had booked the hotel based on those photos, I was told I would need to pay an additional $280+ to upgrade to a room similar to what was advertised.\n\nThe pool is also much smaller than it appears in the photos. While I understand that the hotel is close to the beach and guests may not rely heavily on the pool, the images are clearly exaggerated and make it look much larger than it actually is.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was another disappointment. Not all items listed are available every day; instead, they rotate (for example, beef sausage one day, chicken sausage another). The breakfast is very basic, and if you’re choosing this hotel mainly for breakfast, I would not recommend it.\n\nThe location is good, but for $10–$20 more per night, you can find better hotels that won’t leave you feeling disappointed after a long flight. Additionally, any notes or special requests sent in advance were completely ignored. Most of the staff were not particularly friendly, and even a simple smile felt rare.",

I was here for 6 nights for work, and the team moved me to a room that would be better for working in (desk, quiet area). I loved that this hotel is at the end of Waikiki, which meant it was quieter and didn't have insane foot traffic. Super easy to get out to the highway, very close to the zoo and beach. Easy enough to get Ubers and Lyfts (although the local cabs are also very good.)\n\nI liked the little food spots nearby that made it easy to pop in and out for each eats. The rental car business in the building is great, and you can get free towels and beach chairs from the front desk (as well as water bottle refilles). The breakfast is OK-- after day 5, I got breakfast elsewhere nearby. It's not a new property, but it doesn't necessarily show its age. Beds were comfy, pillows are pretty squishy and thin.",

You can also check out beach towels and chairs for free.\n\nTips: Elevators can be slow during breakfast hours, so if feasible, I recommend taking the stairs when heading out or going to breakfast (3F).

The included breakfast is fuller than the European continental breakfast with baked goods, yoghurt, oatmeal and eggs or Jimmy Dean sausage sandwiches and superb coffee.  They also have an Asian corner with miso, kimchee and rice. Housekeeping is very efficient.  The front desk is very helpful with beach chairs supplied on request.  We were helped by Dino Besic when we needed a change of rooms and he was vey pleasant and professional.  My wife and I loved it.",

          "text": "Visited in January for the MLK holiday weekend. Weather was good except for Saturday morning rain but cleared up for a beautiful day.\nI had purchased three rooms for my family. One room included the parking. When we arrived we were told the parking lot was full. I told them my room included parking. They doubled checked and no issues about parking after that.  \nRoom one: two beds with sofa sleeper. Three people slept comfortably and the sofa sleeper had a thick mattress. Room was in the front tower which has the elevator by the lobby. Good size room with balcony facing the ocean. Partial view of ocean due to Twin Fin Hotel blocking some views.\n\nRoom two: Superior king room with one bed. Large room with balcony. Partial ocean view due to Twin Fin hotel. Room has very large safe. I was able to fit my large backpack in there. Has a small frig. plenty of drawers for clothes. Corner desk. Balcony has two chairs and small table. Bathroom was small. Shower pressure good with lots of hot water. There was a fan in the shower area. Nice. The lighting around the sink/vanity area was dim. Bed was very comfy. A/C worked very well and not noisy. \n\nRoom three: standard king. This room was in the back tower. Upon entering everything looked fine. Great view of ocean but tried to open balcony and door was locked shut. We called maintenance and immediately told that the balcony was under construction. What! Why weren’t we told at check-in at we wouldn’t have balcony access. I immediately went to the front desk and they apologized but weren’t able to move us. I told my cousin not to unpack in case they moved her. An hour later I was contacted by customer service and I explained what occurred. They were able to locate a room that was just cleaned and moved my cousin. Why give someone an out-of-service balcony room without mentioning it in the first place. When I went to the lobby to exchange the key. I realized that the “customer service” person was the same front desk person who earlier had told me they couldn’t move us. So I want to thank Nainoa for making a wrong Right. Thank you for making this trip for my cousin more enjoyable on her first time in Waikiki.\n\nBreakfast: Breakfast was outdoors on the third floor. While the breakfast options aren’t bad and grateful it was included, the first morning there was very windy and cold. Their tables are out on the open and it wasn’t comfortable trying to hold down the plate and everything. I ended up taking everything to my room.\n\nThe pool is in the same place breakfast is served. It’s so small. Never used it.\n\nLots of places to eat within walking distance.\n\nThe complimentary beach chairs are great. Only chairs, no lounge chairs or umbrellas. Plenty of beach towels. The beach near the hotel is very nice. It’s one of the reasons we chose the Hyatt.\n\nThere’s absolutely nothing bad about this Hyatt. The price was good for the large balcony rooms in the front tower with breakfast included. Convenient to almost everything. Very clean.",

          "text": "Great location five minute walk from the beach. Plenty of shopping nearby and connected to dominos. There is an abc store next door. You get a free edamame appetizer with entree from tikis grill next door when mentioning you stayed at the Hyatt place. $5 daily complimentary at the gallery downstairs which is good for one overpriced $4 soda daily. The breakfast was excellent for a complimentary style buffet. It does get very busy even at 7 am but they have enough seating or take it to your room. Each morning it changed ranging from eggs, pancakes, waffles, French toast sticks, Portuguese sausage, pork sausage or jimmy dean sandwiches. They always had tofu and kimchi. They also had cereal, bagels, bread a toaster, pineapple and yogurt with granola. Different teas and coffee available as well as orange or apple juice. They tidy up the room daily as long as you don’t have the dnd on your door. Sometimes you have to remind them but it does happen. They leave fresh towels, make the bed and take out the trash. We used the daily valet and it was always prompt. We also had them watch our luggage the last night because we had a late night flight. The pool is very small but you have the ocean super close. They have boogie boards and chairs you can check out for free FcFs. We got upgraded to a ocean view room which was incredible but please be mindful of noise even early like 6 am. It’s not always going to be quiet as it is a busy street and the huge dumpster is right outside the hotel. There is also some sort of construction always happening. We had a sound machine and still heard everything. I started using earplugs and that helped but if you are a light sleeper please keep that in mind. This would seem to be a general problem in Waikiki as it’s just a loud busy city. The Marriott across the street would also share this problem with this busy street. I don’t know if the noise level is a problem with inside rooms that don’t have balcony’s.",

When I mentioned this at the front desk, I was told I would need to pay an additional $280+ to upgrade to the room shown in the pictures.\n\nThe pool is much smaller than it appears online. While I understand the hotel is close to the beach, the photos clearly exaggerate the size. The breakfast buffet was very basic, not all advertised items were available daily, and the food was often cold. If breakfast is important to you, this is not a good choice.\n\nAlthough the location is convenient, for just $10–$20 more per night you can find much better hotels nearby. Special requests sent in advance were completely ignored, and most of the staff were unfriendly, with little to no customer service warmth.",

          "text": "I stayed here recently for vacation via a deal on Travelzoo. I was debating between giving this hotel a 3 or a 4 star. If I could give it three and a half, I would. However, there were things that knocked it down lower. \n\nThe room itself is very average and smaller than they made it appear to be on their website. The main bedroom area is nice and newly renovated, but the bathroom was a bit moldy and the walls were peeling. I do get the complaints people made about the shower pressure being low, but it wasn't as bad as they said either. It's just not going to gush out at you. At least it didn't flood the floors, which is a problem I had at other hotels in the past. \n\nThe bedroom does have that tacky popcorn ceiling, which makes the hotel look very dated. We upgraded to the ocean view room. While I appreciated being able to see the Pacific right from my balcony, it was obstructed by nearby buildings. It also got noisy at night and there were sketchy people walking the alleyways late at night. Definitely was worth the upgrade, but it was not a five star view by any means. \n\nAs for the hotel itself, it's good, but not great. The breakfast is bland, as many commenters have said in the past, but it's not terrible. There were enough tables and chairs out for the crowds that came by to eat in the morning. The birds were a problem, but staff did a good job shooing them away. The birds also appeared in the lobby of the hotel, which is because it's an open air space. Most of the time, they had a hot breakfast, but one day it was the microwaveable breakfast sandwiches, which I didn't like. It is worth the money, in my opinion, especially since food prices are so high in Waikiki. \n\nI did have one meal at the Placery, since I had a dining credit. The food was nothing to write home about. It is worth using the daily credit, though, since you can get snacks and drinks for cheaper than the nearby ABC stores.\n\nThe pool is very small and not conducive for swimming. The shade made it too cold to use for a long period of time. I would have liked it if they also had a jacuzzi. The fitness center looked fine, but I didn't use it during my stay. \n\nThe front desk staff was very nice and accommodating. They went out of their way to assist us with things we needed, such as signing up for the Lei making class (which we enjoyed) and getting us better beach chairs. Definitely a four star for service. The gift shop was fine as well. The staffer there was nice and we did buy a few things from him. \n\nHousekeeping was decent as well. They didn't have a set time when they'd make up your room, but they always did it. We only had to ask them about it once. I wish the hotel provided toiletries in the room without having to ask for them, though. \n\nHotel is in a good, but not great, location. The beach is very close by foot and it's near a lot of restaurants, bars and shops. It can get a little sketchy at night, but I didn't go out that late on my trip, so it wasn't an issue. \n\nOverall, it's a fine hotel, but not a luxurious or five star resort by any means. If I ever come back to Honolulu, I will probably stay at a more resort based property instead.",

She did an amazing job keeping our room clean every day and went above and beyond during an unexpected situation. While we were sitting on our balcony, someone from an upper floor threw food down onto our balcony, causing a loud crash that startled us. Shortly after, birds came down for the food, which made the situation uncomfortable. Mildred handled it promptly and professionally, cleaning everything thoroughly.\n\nThe hotel itself is well located and comfortable, but it was the genuine care, kindness, and responsiveness of Joy and Mildred that truly elevated our stay.

          "text": "The Hyatt Place Waikīkī Beach was a great place for a cost efficient stay on the outskirts of Waikiki. Room prices are very reasonable, especially compared to the rest of the area. \n\nWhen you check in, they give you reusable water bottles to refill at several filtered water stations around the hotel.  You also get pool towel keys to exchange at the front desk for towels whenever you want them. All 3 elevators were working when we were there, so it was pretty quick getting to our room. The rooms were kind of small, but it doesn’t matter since you probably won’t be spending much time in the room. I believe all rooms have a balcony, which is nice to relax on at the end of a long day.\n\nThe breakfast was pretty average, but it was free and had all the basics like eggs, sausage, fruits, waffles, etc. When you sit down to eat breakfast, DO NOT LEAVE FOOD UNATTENDED! I saw three different instances while eating breakfast where a family went up to get something else, and within about 15 seconds, a flock of birds were enjoying the food. Next to the breakfast area is a small pool, but Waikīkī beach, would be a much better place to take a dip in the water. \n\nThe hotel has a dominoes built right next to the lobby, and small bar and cafe to grab items if you need them. However, the best place to go is the ABC store about a minutes walk on the way to the beach. They have everything you need from toiletries, alcohol, snacks, food, and souvenirs!\n\nValet parking was full every day we are at the hotel, but it was not a big deal since there were several parking options nearby. If valet is full, I would recommend parking at the Waikīkī Sunset parking garage about a 2 min walk away for $45/24hrs. You press a button to take a ticket (do not lose) upon entering the garage, with most available spots on higher floors. Once you park, you’ll have to take the stairs down as you would need a Sunset Hotel key to get to the elevators. Coming back up, you can take the elevator in the Sunset hotel to get to the floor where you parked without using a keycard. While exiting you pay for 24hrs, and they give you a return receipt with a QR code that you will use if coming back.",

The hotel also offers beach towels and boogie boards, but I didn’t get to use them due to dealing with the credit card situation.\n\nOverall, not a stay I’d choose again unless there was some sort of overhaul.",

We are a family of 4 kiddos are 18/16. \n\nWe chose this hotel because of the room. It was booked through points. \n\nArrival and Pre-Arrival - Knowing we are going during the week of Christmas, I called them twice before arrival to make sure they had the room category and type picked out as shown on the virtual tour of the website. \n\nWe arrived late, luckily they still had spots in the valet. Got right checked in, got our little bag with water bottles, before getting checked in I said can you verify the room type and category and she said yup all good to go. Well, we went upstairs around 11pm to our room. wow, that room was small cramped and craptastic to say the least. I knew that was not the room I paid for. I went down and the lady at the front cant remember her name wasnt really helpful and swore we were in the right room category, etc - and the only options I was given was they are sold out and I can switch to another room the next day and they would credit me points for a day, but we really didnt want to move so at that time I turned it down. Saddened, because I was not getting what I paid for I went back near midnight, that is where I met Kaylee(sp) she was the bartender as well as at the front, I told her my story and she said she understands and apologized, and said we are sold out, but I will give you an upgraded view same room you should have gotten. Long story short, they should have people like Kaylee always working the front desk, amazing. Next day as promised they moved us to what we should have had in the first place with a better view. \n\nStay in the new room was great, enough room not cramped, in the remodled tower I think thats what she said the dominoes side. \n\nBreakfast was good, decent options, and coffee and tea options. Go to the third floor, our first day we went in the lobby and saw breakfast there lol but the actual full breakfast buffet is on the 3rd floor. We would actually take our food and go back to the lobby cause we are protected against wind and birds. \n\nAll in all after the hotel room incident it was a great fix. Although we were lucky enough to get the valet parking (they do not have self park) if you do not get that they will point you to across the street to park there, I cant speak on this since we didnt have to do that. \n\nI would consider the hotel again, just was dissappointed about the room stuff.",

          "text": "My family chose this hotel because it was the most wheelchair accessible option we could find in Waikiki. The accessible room is big, with ample space in the bathroom, grab bars in the shower and by the toilet, and a folded shower seat. The only issues in the room is that the bathroom sink is a little high for someone in a wheelchair and opening the door to get out of the room would be hard without help. We didn't use the pool or pool lift, mostly because the angle of the buildings meant the pool itself never got any direct sunlight (although the deck did, depending on the time).\n\nThe beds are comfortable, although definitely on the softer side. The breakfast buffet was okay, but not great. It usually had some type of egg (scrambled, breakfast sandwich), bread & bagels, yogurt & granola, juices, and fruit (typically apples, pineapple, or banana), and occasionally sausage, bacon, or waffles. There's filtered water stations in the lobby, which was really handy and you get a bottle of water upon check-in to use throughout your stay.\n\nThe gym has a small weight rack, a cable machine, treadmills, bikes, and one peloton bike. The beach is a short walk away and I preferred being on the farther end of Waikiki where it's not quite as busy with crowds. Everything is very walkable and there's good food and coffee options nearby. The staff at the hotel are really great and were very accommodating and helpful with our requests and accessibility needs. Would definitely recommend for anyone in a wheelchair or mobility issues.",

The loaner beach chairs were very nice to have, get them at the front desk early since they can run out. We also got 2 reusable water bottles at check in-not sure if this is a Hyatt Discoverist perk or if everyone gets them and there were water bottle refilling stations by the elevator and lobby. Breakfast was good during our week stay and varied from scrambled eggs and Portuguese sausage on some days and mediocre Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches on other days. The everyday breakfast fare included the typical yogurt, fruit, toast/bagels, cold cereals. Also available daily which was nice to have was hot rice, tsukemono(pickled cucumbers), kim chee and tofu for the miso soup. The service here was great and would recommend to anyone visiting Waikiki.",

          "text": "1 star for Hyatt Regency Reston VA - a hotel that's forgotten the true meaning of hospitality.\n\nMy experience started off on the wrong foot with Sabina at reception, who embodied the antithesis of hospitality. Unkind, unprofessional, and impatient, she made check-in a nightmare. When my card was declined, she flat-out told me to try another one or there was nothing she could do ( in a very condescending manner)- without even checking if the terminal was working! It took the intervention of the kind and patient Ekram to sort things out with the same card. Sadly, Sabina's attitude wasn't an isolated incident - I witnessed her treating others with the same lack of warmth.\n\nThe hotel's facilities and lounge area looked nice, but that's about it. The noise from the event was overwhelming, and the room didn't live up to expectations either. Terrible creamy old towels, Dirt and grime in the bathroom, a vent spewing debris, and a lack of deep cleaning despite the hefty price tag (almost  $400 a night for a 4-star hotel?!) made me question the value.\n\nThe saving grace? The location in Reston Town Centre, surrounded by restaurants and activities, and Masti Indian Restaurant downstairs (their food's amazing!). But that's not enough to redeem this hotel's poor service and lack of hospitality. Hyatt, you're selling hospitality, not just beds - time to remind and train your staff what that means! 🙅‍♂️",

Food was great and reasonably priced. Kids menu too. Also a Market Place shop for Starbucks, sweatshirts,  cards, ice cream bars, aspirin, chips, etc. There is a swimming pool and a gym too. We did not use either.  Ice skating rink outside was very busy (February stay).  Lots of options of various places to eat in the Reston Town Center area. \nThe W&OD Trail (Washington & Old Dominion Trail) paved for biking, walking and running  is about two blocks away and 45 miles long. This hotel is located in an area has everything you need from restaurants and movie theater, for a relaxing and comfortable stay.",

          "text": "This is a great hotel located in the heart of Reston, Virginia and close to Washington Dulles Airport (IAD) by either the Washington Metro Silver Line (which has a stop right at the airport and also at Reston Town Center (RTC); I like to walk, so that's what I did (about 10 minutes) but I believe the hotel can also arrange for a pick-up at the RTC metro station if you prefer), or by Uber, Lyft or taxi. The hotel is well-designed and -constructed, and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. Reston is an upscale town that is delightful and safe. There was a festive Thanksgiving parade when I was there and everyone was having a fun time. There is a popular and excellent restaurant directly connected to the hotel named Capital Burger, which gets rave reviews for its burgers and other entrees. The service is top notch. Additionally, there are numerous restaurants only steps away, including the respected North Italia. For those wanting something a little less fancy, there is a Chipotle a block away, along with many other dining options. One will definitely not go hungry at this location. There are also several charming retail stores in the town center. The hotel has an indoor pool, sauna and well-equipped gym. If you upgrade or have loyalty program access to the Regency Lounge, you can enjoy a great breakfast plus evening canapes on weekdays. (Check with them regarding their Lounge schedule.) The thing that really distinguishes this hotel is its team. The Front Desk representatives are knowledgeable and helpful. The housekeepers go the extra mile. (Special thanks to the delightful Maria H. for ensuring that I always had enough bottled water.) Mika in the Lounge is hard-working, thoughtful, smart and terrific. And the senior management (particularly Alex and Anil) is off-the-charts superb. The executives truly care about their colleagues and guests. If anything isn't 100%, they make it right with a capital R. I was extremely impressed by the team, and in my experience, it's a hotel team's commitment to superior hospitality that takes the guest experience to a different and higher level. The team at this hotel absolutely distinguished itself in this respect. Overall, it was an outstanding stay in every way.",

For being all booked for a busy weekend they managed it all well.\nOne note, they need slightly better customer service with check in and check out.\nOffered to help with my bags after I already walked in and before I checked in- this could be offered at or after check in.\nAt check out, it was confusing if I was good to go or if I they needed anything else. A simple, “thanks for staying, have a nice day” would’ve been clear that I was good to go.",

I had a long travel day and was getting into the hotel after midnight and was thinking how awful the day had been. I get up to my room to find an amazing assortment of desserts as well as a birthday card from the staff. This level of going above and beyond really made my day and all of a sudden the travel wasn’t so bad. Thank you!",

The room was serviced daily, the best comfortable and those pillows were out of the world. The restaurant was inviting and cosy and the food was delicious, with a wait staff eager to please. The downtown rail system was my only contention, making the parking experience a little inconvenient.",

Michelle at the front desk greeted me warmly and welcomed us in the room with a welcome card and a free bottle of prosecco. The service is truly above and beyond. We slept a little late towards the morning and the curtains were so dark that we couldn’t tell 😂🥹 The furniture and bathroom are also really modern. Highly recommend booking this property!",

My only complaint was with the breakfast service in the Griffin Lounge; it seemed to be short-staffed as it was pretty chaotic with all the guests jostling each other for breakfast, drinks, etcetera and the poor woman who was making the omelettes had to do double duty fixing the coffee machine, cleanup the mess at the coffee bar and bus the tables.\n\nThat said, I'll be back, as the hotel is very nice and I liked the staff and proximity to my office in Houston.",

The highlight of our stay was Ana, a Filipina J1 staff member, who went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. My sister were looking for a Filipino food and she provided great recommendations  and kindly walked us to Finn Hall across the street from the hotel.\nWe also encountered Ana again at Griffin, where she ensured our dining experience was excellent and made sure we had everything we needed. During checkout, she assisted us once more at the buffet area. Her professionalism, kindness, and attentiveness truly stood out.\nAdditionally, the entire team was friendly and welcoming, including the chef at the omelette station, who was fantastic.\nThank you to Ana and the JW Marriott team for making our stay memorable. See you soon—maybe in San Antonio! Give us a call!",

          "text": "Until this weekend, I had not had a bad JW Marriott experience.  That streak is now broken.  \n\nFirst, be advised that there is construction at/near the entrance of the hotel.  It has made a dicey valet situation worse.  And while you will get a VERY long email about the valet move, it's difficult to locate and the signage is bad. Also the relocated valet stand is just bad -- where we had our choice of WALKING THROUGH a labrynth of dumpsters on one side of the road, or the incredibly foul smell and waste water runoff of (hidden) dumpsters on the other side of the street.  The valet service is pretty slow, and due at its relocated spot, now requires the valet folks to drive around the block (adding to the time it takes to get a vehicle).  You are supposed to be able to text to add your car to the que for pick up.  That worked for us on Saturday.  But on Sunday morning, it did not, and instead we received a text back saying we needed to come down to the valet stand to request retreival of the car.  We did, and since we were checking out, it was with all of our bags in tow.  Once there, we were told it was going to be \"quite a long wait\", with absolutely no estimate provided, and only 2 guys shagging cars from the garage (one with zero amount of hustle).  We waited for 45 minutes, standing on the corner with all of our bags.  There was no where to sit.  Fortunately the weather was decent as there was no awning or weather protection for us or the valet stand attendant.  DO NOT RECOMMEND THE VALET SITUATION AT PRESENT. Self park, use an Uber/Lyft, or stay somewhere else.  \n\nThe room was also unfortunate.  I often stay at JWs, and book a standard room.  The \"Poet\" really did not meet my minimum expectation for JW standards.  The room itself was coffin-like -- too small for the JW cost level.  The TV was located in a bad spot.  The curtains on the widow overlooking nothing did not close fully.  The bathroom was a motel style bathroom with the sink exposed to the bedroom, and the toilet and shower stall in a WC.  The barndoor of the WC both did not close fully, and had such a large gap on the back side (unrelated to the lack of closing) that you could clearly see whatever was happening on the toilet from the bed.  Inside the WC was truly depressing, as the light was connected to a fan that rattled loudly, and the shower was old, small, and in need of renovating.  \n\nAt $450 for a single night, I shouldn't have to scrutinize the representative photos for potential issues.  While the photos show the weird bed/window/kinda TV set up; they do not show the shower/WC, indicate that the sink is in the bedroom, show the tiny closet, or otherwise convey just how small and cramped this room is.  \n\nAt checkout, the front desk representative said the rooms were due for renovation.  I would agree.  And I wouldn't stay there again until that happens.",

From check-in with Michelle, who was clearly a UH hospitality student or graduate based on her precise delivery of welcome and check-in, to the two gentlemen offering help with my limited luggage, to the restaurant staff, every single person on the premises contributed to the brand perception in a positive way. \n\nI was using a loyalty reward, so I can’t speak to the value of the price. It was a great value to me. My room was upgraded with request as well. Another kudos to the team. \n\nThe photos do not do the large room justice it was expansive and hard to depart. \n\nParking is a challenge unless you pay a hefty valet… or are local. Locals know how to park for free on the street. Still, property crime in the city may give one pause choosing this option. Also, views are not skyline or otherwise glamorous. \n\nStill, I think this is my new lodging of choice when staying downtown. Besides the phenomenal club, front desk, and cleaning teams, the rooms are exceptionally clean and comfortable.",

          "text": "When I tell you this hotel has the best hospitality I've ever seen, I mean they have the BEST hospitality I've ever seen, and this is coming from someone who lives in Las Vegas and has stayed in some of the premium suites at those resorts.  Everyone from the front desk staff, to the room service waiters, to the in-house chauffeur were incredible.  Always customer-focused, always friendly and helpful.  This morning when I ordered room service for breakfast, I put a note on the order asking to sub the side of potatoes for french fries if possible, figuring it's no problem if they can't do it.  When they delivered, they apologized profusely that they had no fries available, and instead the chef insisted on making me an entire order of french toast (in addition to the actual meal I ordered) as an apology.  Talk about above and beyond!  The breakfast sandwich and the french toast were both amazing as well, and reasonably priced as far as room service in a high end hotel goes.\n\nExtra special shoutout to Zoe and Yesenia at the front desk who provided some fantastic suggestions of where to go when we had a few hours to kill, and quickly arranged a complimentary car to take us.\n\nWe were also upgraded to an Executive suite which was fabulous.  Spacious living room, large dining room table, the bed was very comfy, and the bathroom had a massive bathtub that was perfect for relaxing after a long day of walking.   Everything was clean and exactly as it should be.\n\nThis hotel has basically ruined all other hotels for me, and I'll ensure I check availability here any time I'm in Houston in the future before I even start to look anywhere else.  This hotel embodies everything that all Marriott properties should strive for, and the management should be proud of their staff for not just meeting but exceeding expectations at literally every single opportunity.  I hope this review finds its way to them.  We'll be seeing you again for sure!",

The room, lobby, and elevators were really clean and the hallways had strong air conditioning, which I really appreciated.  \n\nThe staff were fantastic.  We called down to the front desk with a plumbing problem and maintenance was in our room in 5 minutes fixing the problem and very apologetic.  \nMy husband and I have stayed in lots of hotels and have never seen a hotel fix a maintenance problem so quickly and efficiently.\n\n  Downtown Houston was a mess with all kinds of construction.  The valet was very good with carrying our bags to the front desk and with having our car ready after we called.  Valet was $60 but I think that is expected when parking downtown.\n\nI would definitely recommend this hotel and can't wait to return!",

My husband was really impressed by his knowledge of the wines and cocktails.  Our experience here was fabulous. I’m looking forward to our next trip now back to Houston.",

Each day we were shuttled via their complimentary shuttling service. Drivers Logan and George took good care of us, driving us to various venues such as dinner at McCormick & Schmick's, ticks to Trans-Siberian Orchestra at Toyota Center, and our experience at Meow Wolf. Logan was great at suggesting many different spots in the downtown area. The staff in the downstairs bar was very friendly. The club lounge also had some of the greatest people daily, serving a very indulging breakfast. The omelet station was a definite plus! I highly recommend this hotel. JW Marriott rarely disappoints, just in general.",

The staff is consistently friendly and welcoming, providing excellent service that makes you feel taken care of the moment you arrive. The lobby is beautifully kept—spotlessly clean and made even more inviting with festive Christmas decorations that create a warm, elegant holiday atmosphere.\n\nThe rooms are just as impressive: clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully maintained. And you can’t beat the location—directly connected to Lenox Mall, making shopping, dining, and exploring incredibly convenient.\n\nOverall, it’s a perfect blend of comfort, service, and convenience. Highly recommended for anyone visiting the area.",

I hate I didn't wear the bath robe, lol. The restaurant was nice and the ballroom and catering was 10 out of 10 thanks to those Southern Grits!!! Would recommend and so easy to access from the airport via the train. Convenience!!!!",

In fact, we booked a large room with adjoining rooms for our daughters, which was perfect for our family and friends stay and the rooms were really large. \n\nAdditionally, might I add, that the front desk customer service receptionist was beyond pleasant and welcoming, including the valet to the lounge staff (Sheron). We also stayed on the 16th floor and the window views of Atlanta were unbelievable. The rooms were indeed spotless, the king-size bed and sheets were extremely comfortable, and the pillows were like clouds. \n\nThe 25th floor lounge food and room service food were very delicious; in addition to the lounge being beautiful and super clean. \n\nLastly, The JW Marriott is right next door to Lenox Mall. This was a major plus. Therefore, the JW Marriott Buckhead is now in my top three for superior hotels in Atlanta, and I will definitely be returning. I was extremely satisfied with my entire experience.",

          "text": "Decided to stay here for one of the Pure Rooms. In theory, a Pure room should help with creating an allergen free environment with the air quality and cleaning protocols. Having the air purifier is a big bonus in these rooms. I also think it would be helpful if the Pure rooms were in better condition overall and were absent of other environmental allergens like mold. This property is quite old and is showing signs of its age. The bathroom had mold and there was cracking in the mouldings in the room. The bed was comfortable but some of the sheets were dirty. Compared to other JWs we’ve stayed at, this one didn’t meet the luxury experience you expect for the JW name and rates unfortunately. I think the standards for Pure rooms need to be reviewed at the execution level as the marketing is on point with many hopeful travellers looking for a solution to environmental allergens.",

We were told we had to move.\n\t•\tRoom 2: The air conditioning didn’t work.\n\t•\tRoom 3: The bed setup was incorrect.\n\t•\tRoom 4 (our current room): Once again, the air conditioning doesn’t work.\n\nTo make things worse, the lack of concern from staff has made it abundantly clear that guest comfort is not a priority. We’ve received little more than empty apologies and no real effort to make things right.\n\nThis is not the level of service or quality expected from a JW Marriott. Instead of relaxing and enjoying our stay, we’ve spent our entire evening being shuffled from room to room without resolution — and feeling like no one here actually cares.\n\nExtremely disappointed.",

I had never been to this hotel and was unaware that was not the main entrance, it did looked like it, I rang a bell that was near the doors and the front desk unlocked the door for me to enter. Later I found out it was an entrance it was just locked at that time. The doorman proceeded to borate me for entering that way this is horrible service.\n2) I used the Bonvoy app to check in and received my room number and key ahead of my arrival. However this hotel requires a separate physical elevator key which I had to wait in a check in line to obtain, this was a holiday weekend and they were busy. The convenience of check in on line and mobile key is pointless.\n3) I purchased access to the lounge with my stay, at the lounge the coffee and tea station was closed with a sign that indicated the machines were not functioning and they did not offer another option, they also had no fresh fruit or other snacks as advertised.\n4) My room did not have coffee, tea or even a machine, I brought this to the attention of 3 employees who were all in disbelief and said I just needed to look in the drawers. I advised them I had and they were all empty, their response was it should be there. I ended up waiting till the cafe was open in the morning and purchased a coffee and advised the desk clerk again of the lack of coffee or even a machine in my room, he had the same response as the others.\nAn employee did came up to my room  to \"check\" and thought it was funny, he stated, \"what do you know you were right\". This is terrible service from multiple staff, rude and very disappointing. \n5) I had dinner at the hotel restaurant where I ordered the Salmon with fresh vegetables and arugula, no vegetables were served and the arugula was warm and wilted. At this point I didn't say anything as I didn't think the staff would do anything about it.\n5)The description of the room is for premium bedding, I have to say the mattress was so uncomfortable I slept on the couch and decided to spend the rest of my stay in Atlanta in a different hotel even though I had already paid for the Marriott.\n5) During checkout the clerk asked how my stay was as I was walking out the door I told her not good and she said she would send me a survey, I have not received a survey.",

I had a king room on the 14th floor which had a great view of the city skyline. The executive lounge for Bonvoy elite members was very nice and provided a nice breakfast each morning and snacks in the evening along with a great view from the 25th floor. The hotel is attached to a mall which provided different food options and was just nice to walk around. I did not have a car but did notice that parking was $45 / night, so be aware of that. There is a MARTA station right next door, so the train is an option from the airport to the hotel. If given the chance to be in the area again, I would definitely stay at the JW again .",

We had a very uncomfortable sleep due to the pillows and the hot room that would not cool. Our room was on the top floor due to my husband’s Ambassador status but we were next door to the lounge and heard the staff banging the door repeatedly getting ready for breakfast before 6am. Not an experience we expected and will probably not stay here again.",

They offer wine and strawberries upon arrival… we didn't receive those until we called and asked but were only given little macaroons and water. (The macaroons were super good) however still didn’t receive our wine until a different guy at the front saw us. He then informed us that we didn’t get breakfast included.. which was in the package. They also have a package for free parking but when asked the woman at the front desk said they didn’t own the parking ramp and couldn’t do free parking for the hotel. So super weird but overall, it was a good stay (just maybe stay away from the packages)",

It turns out, he was inside on his phone.  The shower in my room wasn't very warm.  Engineering came to fix it, but it wasn't fixed.  A pet peeve of mine is when a server isn't trained or empowered to solve a customer's issue.  I encountered such a situation at Aurora (the lobby restaurant).  It wasn't a capacity issue because the hotel was completely dead.  I am Ambassador Elite with Marriott with 200 nights/year and wouldn't come back here.  I will leave a similar review on Marriott.com.  Sorry, they had every opportunity to fix these issues.  The bad reviews of this place are accurate.  I get the impression the workers are counting the minutes to leave.",

Most importantly, my room was clean and spacious.  I had a great view of Minneapolis from the 30th floor (not sure if that changes depending on which side of the hotel you stay on).  I would stay here again.  Location is great: downtown Minneapolis within walking distance of the basketball arena and the baseball stadium.  There are a lot of restaurants to choose from in walking distance also.  If the weather is bad, you can use the skywalks to get around downtown.",

We were given the excuse of it's the \"Minnesota State Fair\" weekend and the concert was there that night, which is why we booked for this hotel at the beginning of the year.\nThe letter was from the Mall of America Marriott stating that they were going to pay for one night's room at their location, which is over 10 miles away... \nAt NO POINT, did anyone ever contact us to inform us of what they did.  \nAt NO POINT, did anyone ever apologize for NOT honoring our reservation that the location we booked and had already paid for.\nAND FINALLY, the BIG kick to the rear-end ... they KNEW they were going to do this days in advance, AND never bothered to tell us!\nI've attached the letter we were handed... the date they wrote the \"you don't get what you paid for letter\" that moves us 10+ miles away... was 4 days BEFORE our arrival at the hotel.\nNever even bothered contacting us ahead of time... which would have saved us a few hours and $50 in parking at the location we couldn't stay at.\nNOT\nONE\nSINGLE\nAPOLOGY\nfrom anyone at anytime.",

          "text": "I have to say, for the price I paid to stay at the Marriott City Center, I expected a bit more than what I got. We were on the 14th floor, and the noise level at night was ridiculous. I get that it's downtown and noise is part of the package, but I would have thought the windows would provide at least a little bit of soundproofing. But hey, maybe that's too much to ask for.\n\nThen there’s the fact that they charge extra for turndown service. I know hotels need to make money, but charging guests for something that used to be standard is just absurd.\n\nBut the real kicker? Walking into the room to find a bottle of water that comes with a $6 price tag. It's not gold, it's not crystal—it's just plain plastic. Thankfully, growing up in the '80s, I’m no stranger to tap water, so I survived.\n\nAnd what’s with only having two full-sized towels in the bathroom? Are we cutting costs here, Marriott? I’ve stayed in budget motels where I got five oversized towels and more washcloths than I knew what to do with. I guess my expectations are higher than what Marriott considers “fancy.” But hey, maybe I’m just out of touch with what people expect from a 4-star hotel these days.\n\nIf you’re charging close to $200 a night, I’d expect more than two towels and a $6 bottle of water. But clearly, Marriott and I have different standards.",

          "text": "DO NOT STAY HERE. EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE BY HOTEL MANAGEMENT. BEWARE OF ATTACHED \nMARRIOTT PARKING\" PARKING GARAGE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND STAYING SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n\nStayed here the past week with my Nephew celebrating his high school graduation. We had a fantastic time in the city and were a quick walking distance to Target Field and the Target Center. The Twins were in town all week so we attended three of their games. We also went to the Vikings preseason game vs the Raiders, which was also within walking distance. Tonight we went to the Lynx game at the Target Center vs the Mystics.\n\nBEWARE if parking in the attached parking garage! The one plastered with all the signs that say “Marriott Parking.” Apparently they aren’t affiliated with the garage. I was told tonight by the manager that their contract ended 4 months ago. I guess that is not enough time for the garage OR the Marriott to take down all of the signs saying “Marriott Parking.” I guess it also isn’t enough time for the Marriott to train their front desk staff on the fact that they should no longer instruct guests to park there anymore since the contract for the affiliation no longer exists. I can’t help but feel like it's a flat out lie. If your affiliation with another business ended FOUR MONTHS ago, then either party would have ensured by now that all signs advertising the affiliation would be taken down. \n\nI have been grossly overcharged multiple times during our stay for parking in the attached garage. The Marriott manager wants no part of helping me, accepts no responsibility for me being told to park there, and offered absolutely no assistance in helping me contact the garage or secure a refund for the overcharges.\n\nThe front desk attendant I first spoke to about it called “the manager” who was allegedly in his car driving on his way home. He made some incorrect statements to “the manager” and neglected to correct himself when I pointed out what he said was not correct. When the call ended I asked for the manager's business card. The front desk attendant went “out back” to get one for me and came back with “the manager.” When I asked if this was the manager that was just on the phone driving home, I was informed this was a “different” manager. Why in the world would he have called a manager who wasn’t working when there was a manager on duty and IN the hotel? Why was this on duty manager not the one contacted in the first place? I definitely feel like there was some shady business being pulled. I've never had a situation handled like this at a hotel before. \n\nSo just beware that even though there are about 20 signs in the garage that say “Marriott Parking”, and the front desk staff may tell you to park in the attached garage, that is NOT actually Marriott Parking and if you get overcharged or have any issues in or with the garage labeled as “Marriott Parking”, Marriott will give you the brush off and NOT assist you with said issue. The only effort the manager will make to help you is to take every opportunity to tell you they can’t. \n\nHaving stayed at many Marriotts in my travels, I have never received such poor customer service or felt like I was being lied to or brushed off. This hotel location is great, the hotel itself is very nice and clean, but it is the last place I would recommend anyone to stay that is visiting Minneapolis or the Twin Cities.",

The suite was clean, scenic, spacious, comfortable and quiet. \n\nThe breakfast buffet is typical but very good and had plenty of fresh fruit options. Hot foods varied each day which was nice. Although it would have been nice to see croissants and/or a few donuts/rolls like other sister properties. \n\nThe concierge is a cozy place and offers a nice outdoor seating option that many properties don’t have. Phillip took care of everything flawlessly. He went around to every table to see if we needed anything and always greeted me every morning with a cheery smile to start my day! Bezawit was very friendly and there in the evening replenishing beverages and snacks. \n\nThey have a nice bar and restaurant that also offers takeout food in a hurry. The gift shop is larger and has nice selection of souvenirs. Parking is easy and next to the hotel. \n\nGreat stay with nice staff including the GM (very visible everyday around the hotel)!",

Shout-outs to Cori, who gave me an amazing room with killer views on the 30th floor and to Andrew and Kevin. who were very nice and helpful.\n\n2. M Club (concierge lounge) with good breakfast options.  Evening choices were rather limited for the most part fried finger food.  No beer or wine options.\n\n3. Excellent fitness center with multiple weight machines, free weights and cardio equipment.  A Peloton Bike and three Life fitness Peloton like bikes were much appreciated.\n\n4. Daily maid service (which seems to be rare these days)\n\n5. Very comfortable clean rooms with refrigerator and safe.\n\n6. Excellent location on south 7th street walking distance to both Twins and Vikings stadiums.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. No pool or hot tub.\n\n2. Parking-Hotel uses city lot next door and charges above and beyond if you just parked there yourself.  Valet parking available for between $49-$60 a day.  $29 if you park yourself\n\nParking lot directly across the street was $7.00 after 4 pm and good until 8 a.m. the next morning.  Even better street parking was free from 10 pm to 8 am each day, $3.00 an hour from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm, four hour limit.\n\nEven better than that the meters on LaSalle between 10th and 11th street, three blocks away were free from 6:00 pm-8:00 am, Monday through Friday and free all day Saturday and Sunday. You could park at these meters for 10 hours for $1.00 an hour\n\nMy total parking costs for the week was $32.00\n\nVisit my travel blog at spontaneoustravel-wellplanned.com for other travel tips and recommendations.\n\nCheers!\n\nMarius\n\n",

Multiple emergency vehicle sirens, loud cars, throbbing bass that you can hear and feel from nearby clubs. Earplugs help but not enough. I did not get to sleep until 3am when things finally start to quiet down.\n\n> The lack of direct street access is an inconvenience that became a hassle the \n\n> M club lounge is small but nothing special, particularly after hours. \n\n> Housekeeping passed us by 2 consecutive days. \n\n> There always seems to be a line to check in starting at 4pm. \n\n> There was no point to calling the front desk after 4pm - the line was busy or just rang endlessly. \n\nBottom Line: The location is good and I did have some positive employee interactions, but if you want to sleep, book elsewhere.

At the restaurant in the lobby, they completely forgot to place my order so after waiting 20 minutes for food, I learned nothing was coming.  They barely had any help with luggage - meaning few carts and even fewer bell hops.  The room was clean and smelled fresh.  The ambiance was beautiful.  Although they were aware that four hundred people had registered for the conference, they had only four people checking folks in.  The lines were 30 minutes long inside the hotel.  The location is fantastic.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  ",

The room was neat, clean, and very comfortable, with cozy bedding and a quiet atmosphere that made falling asleep before our 5:00 a.m. flight effortless. Guests frequently highlight how comfortable the beds and soundproofing are, making it easy to rest well even next to a busy international airport.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages is its unbeatable location connected directly to Philadelphia International Airport via an indoor walkway, so you can go from your room to check-in without stepping outside. The convenience factor for early departures like ours cannot be overstated. There’s also a free airport shuttle available on request, which adds another layer of stress-free travel.\n\nBeyond the convenience, the staff at the hotel generally receive high marks for friendliness and helpfulness, and amenities like the on-site restaurant and bar offer a pleasant place to relax before or after a long travel day. Whether you’re staying for just a night before a flight or returning after a trip, this Marriott delivers a solid, dependable experience that makes airport layovers feel almost enjoyable. Highly recommended if you want comfort, convenience, and a great night's rest before hitting the skies. ✈️",

The check in process was easy and there was everything you could want at your fingertips.  Room was clean and comfortable.  They have a bridge where you can walk over to your terminal or a shuttle that I had know wait time.  I'm always a bit nervous when I fly. The restaurant and bar area had lots of good options plus a happy hour from 3 to 6.  If you want a stress free travel day I highly recommend staying here.",

We waited for over an hour with only a few people in front of us (I don't think they sat anyone). They then said use an app to order food for the room. The app didn't work, and they knew it didn't work. We then called to order food and were informed that we couldn't. It took a trip to the front desk to get any food ordered.",

I asked him to send somebody up so I can prove to them that we had no hot water. At that time, the gentleman said that in fact, they knew there was a problem. It would be at least 15 minutes to be fixed.  I told him we did not have time because we had to catch an early flight.  When we checked out at the front desk, the manager told us there was no discount or refund despite no hot water.  \nWe are titanium Bonvoy members. However, that should not make any difference, of course.  We should’ve been refunded the cost of our room.  Instead, the front desk manager was arrogant and rude and not helpful.",

This time it was disappointing, particularly at this price point. \n\nFrequent travelers understand that mechanical things can go wrong in a hotel, but we also expect them to be addressed aggressively by management. First, the furnace did not heat, in my room, for the two days I was there.  Then, beginning at supposedly 5-6pm on 12/1/25, the hot water in the hotel quit working.  It was still that way at 5 am, when I departed.  I’m not the guy who’s going to hassle or scream at hotel staff. They were besieged by other guests, and had been given little info to share with guests.   What was most disappointing was that I was told that “the GM and management were coming in early on 12/2, to address the issue with guests.  Where were they all night?",

We were told our room wasn't ready and needed to be cleaned. The manager was rude and disrespectful and acted like we were the ones acting unreasonable. When I tried to get a picture of his name tag he took it off and said he didn't have to identify himself. He said the previous guest had a late checkout and he would never tell a guest to leave. Excuse me but what? What hotel lets a guest stay so late even when another guest has already paid for the room? What about Marriott's guaranteed 4:00 pm check in which is clearly stated on their website. He said housekeeping was working on another room and when they were finished they would clean our room - btw hotel is not sold out. When I said why wouldn't you pull the housekeeper so they could do our room right away his response was \"don't tell me how to do my job\". He then went back to the front desk and started helping other customers with no updates at all. I'm embarrassed to say we paid $800.00 for the one night stay here. So far no apology and no compensation. Finally was given room at 9:00pm. AVOID at all costs. Luckily I have video and pics of the whole ordeal and have a case number with Marriott corporate already. I rarely give bad reviews, but in this case is beyond warranted.",

From check-in to check-out, every interaction I had with the front desk and housekeeping was professional and welcoming. They clearly care about guests, and I appreciate that.\n\nThe Negatives:\nUnfortunately, the property itself does not live up to the Marriott standard I’ve come to expect. The rooms are very outdated — worn furniture, aging décor, and fixtures that look decades old. Water pressure in the shower was frustratingly low, making mornings less than refreshing. I also noticed rust on several light fixtures, which was disappointing and gave the room a neglected feel. On top of that, there was a persistent, pungent odor that made the room uncomfortable to relax in.\n\nFor the rates they charge (especially on certain dates), the value simply isn’t there. While I understand airport hotels can be pricey, the condition of this property does not justify the cost.\n\nBottom Line:\nThe amazing staff deserve better facilities to match their service. Until the rooms are renovated and the maintenance issues addressed, I can’t recommend this hotel, despite my loyalty to Marriott.",

          "text": "Long review but please read so I can save you from ever staying here. Arrived in airport on a late flight. Had an hour and a half drive home. Anyone and everyone who wants can walk into this hotel. There were drunks, homeless people, people smoking a huge blunt roaming around the airport with zero security or any employees for that matter in sight. Any of them can easily walk right into this hotel onto any floor. The front desk said you need your room key to activate the elevator but that was NOT the case. We got on and off without using our key. The hallways have an eerie unsafe feeling and are outdated. Room outdated but thankfully bathroom updated. I truly had a gut feeling that I wasn't safe. And the entire point of staying here was that it is advertised as being so convenient that you can get to it right from inside the terminal. But, that's apparently ONLY if you don't have baggage to claim. There were ZERO signs or instructions on how to get to it from baggage claim. If not for the one employee I could find simply from passing him going the other way on the moving sidewalk,  who explained how to get to it, I would have been faced with getting an uber to an onsite hotel. To get to it from our terminal baggage claim, the instructions were to go outside, walk along a sidewalk, enter the next building, walk all the way down to a wall where there would be an elevator with a tiny sign above it. Then go up one floor and exit. Go around a corner to the skybridge. Very confusing as there again was zero signage as you exited an elevator into a deserted and desolate parking garage. You know how you can trust your gut? Gut feeling felt SO unsafe. And I travel the world and am not squeamish. Finally found sky bridge after passing multiple homeless people, some camped out sleeping in multiple airline wheelchairs as if they were makeshift beds. Why no one patrolled those wheelchairs, I have no idea. Zero airport employees and zero security. Super sketchy. Entered hotel as any nefarious characters could also do. It was late and I had already paid $284 plus fees making my total $330 something. And when I booked, they made sure to tell me there would be no refund. What a racket. They have you at their mercy and they know it. Take my advice. DO NOT stay here. Oh, and after paying $330 they can't even give you a free breakfast like every other chain. Never again. My advice would be to make a short drive 30 minutes away to the main line area and stay there where it's safe.",

There was hair on the bathroom counter and next to the toilet. \nCarpet and furniture and drapes are tired and  worn. \nThe only thing going for this hotel is its location. I will not stay here again. \nMarriot brand has no excuse for poor service, or poorly maintained property.",

          "text": "If you ever stayed in a full service Marriott in the 1990s and want to travel back in time, stay here. This hotel is stuck in 1995, and not in a good way. The rooms are beyond tired. Haven’t been updated in 30 years. The only update to my room was the removal of the single serve shampoo/conditioner etc for the larger bottles fixed to the wall in the shower (and my shampoo bottle was completely empty). The room they originally checked me into was frigid. I called the front desk and asked them to send someone to fix my heat and they told me they would have to move me to a new room because the heat in my particular room was broken. So, why did you check in an Ambassador Elite Bonvoy member into a room that has no heat on a very cold day/night? Good question.\n\nThe concierge lounge is supposed to be reserved for Marriott’s best/loyal customers. The lounge here is truly abysmal. The milk cartons that they had in the lounge was spoiled (like the level of spoil that makes you throw up instantly). I told them this and asked for fresh milk for my coffee - so they brought me a slightly fresher carton of milk yet left all of the other cartons of spoiled milk on the little buffet. The full service restaurant is equally depressing. Dark, limited menu, very low quality food.\n\nBottom line - this hotel needs a gut renovation…or to be demolished and start new. Not much can save this place. I would avoid it.",

The rooms are very well maintained and spacious. I'm a bit of a germaphobe, so cleanliness can make or break an experience for me and i had a pleasant stay. The staff were very friendly and accommodating aswell.\n\nI attended a 3 day conference in their main conference room and we also had our breakfast & lunch meals there. They have nice restaurants within the air port. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others in the area for an overnight or extended stay.",

Ana was very kind and helpful setting us up for the day. She was so nice, we had a stellar experience with her. Ryan was also really helpful and stored our bags for us and let us get in and out of our luggage as needed.\nThere’s a pool you can use and watch airplanes take off in. Even a fire pit outside to relax by. Jorge helped us get the fire pit going and was so very nice to us. There is also a gym and very clean and private shower you can use there.\nMarriott very obviously treats their employees well because the service and hospitality was above and beyond.

          "text": "The Marriott at Tampa International Airport is a wonderful option for early morning flights or late night arrivals.  I had a rental car to return the day before my early flight and wanted an easy hotel option.  Easy indeed!  After dropping off my car, I just had to take the airport tram for two stops, go down one floor, and walk across the airport 3rd floor to the Marriott entrance.  The front desk staff was so efficient, helpful, and pleasant... I was settled in my room within minutes.  The rooms have recently been updated so everything seemed fresh, bright, and there were plenty of outlets in smart places.  I would have enjoyed sitting outside with my laptop, but that area was under construction.  The lounge is small but cozy and relaxing.  My only negative was the lack of noise insulation.  I stay at airport hotels all over the world and am usually amazed at how quiet the aircraft noise it, but this hotel is not as soundproof... I could even hear the person in the room across the hall using their restroom.  But I would definitely stay here again!  In the morning, it only took me 15 minutes to haul my two bags to check-in, take the tram to the E terminal, pass through security, and settle into the Delta Lounge.  Great experience!",

Michelle and Jerry at the desk are always two favorites to see. Norly in the restaurant area is also super pleasant and most helpful. Rooms are clean and spacious. They are truly the reason business and staff return. Best location ever without needing transportation.",

          "text": "I flew up just for the evening from South Florida.  I had an event in the area to attend that evening, still needed to get some work done and take an early flight out the next day.  It hit all my requirements and needs.  Easy access from the terminal - great for arrival and departing.  Access to all landside foot options in the airport.  Great views of the runways, terminals.  A full gym I used both days I was there.  A separate entrance for uber, etc. which is great because the terminal gets REALLY busy.  My hotel room was ready on arrival and they have a bar/restaurant open late.  Room was comfortable.  Price is competitive, but a bit heavier than some Westshore properties  (less than downtown) but you're paying for convenience on this one.   Only downside is you sort of are landlocked a bit or feel like you're in a labryinth if you're trying to leave consistently and visit other areas of Tampa.",

The Tampa Airport Marriott is located right at the airport and a close internal walk to take the airport trams to your designated airline’s terminal.  Furthermore, the front-desk staff were super hospitable explaining the features of the hotel and the rooms were clean and well appointed.   Also, the hotel was quiet; did not hear any noise from the airport.  In terms of the amenities, I was pleasantly surprised as to how well equipped the hotel gym was with sufficient cardio-equipment along with other relevant gym equipment.   Additionally, the restaurant/bar was very good, both from a service and food viewpoint.   After staying here a few times, I can genuinely recommend this hotel, and it is even better when you have an early morning flight or a late arriving flight.",

The walk in showers have not changed and provide a superb experience. It's nice to be greeted as a titanium elite member and most times put on the 6th floor. Shout outs to GinaMarie, Katie, Rose, keiser, Corrine, Michelle, Anna, Yadeira, Akeema, Jade, and Jackie. I love the valet parking here and everyting about the hotel. It would be nice if they had massage center and laundry since they have room for it plus the gym is the best gym anywhere. Thank you for always a super pleasurable experience.",

It was so nice to drop off our rental car and get to our room on the airport network.  Then, with an early flight how great to not have to return a car and just walk across a hall, take the close elevator to check luggage and on to our flight. The staff were super helpful with all our questions about the airport and car drop.  And a cheerful face at 3am is great anyway.  The room was spacious and peaceful and despite being close to the airport was quiet. Also loved the bed very comfortable.  I would stay again",

After a bad experience at the Westin Tampa Bay (where we checked in and checked out the same day) the Tampa Airport Marriott cordially welcomed us for our 3-night stay in the area.  Corrine, with a friendly smile, gladly let us know there were rooms available.  She professionally worked with Cameron, the wonderful front desk supervisor who is the ideal hotel employee, to find a room that we would be happy with.  Although the 5th and 6th floors were being renovated, they made up for the lack of concierge amenities by providing a delicious free breakfast buffet in the Cafe and a few free appetizers in the Skyye Bar & Grille.  In the restaurants, Bonnie started our days off well with a friendly welcome and great service, and Victoria, Alan, and Norly provided positive energy and exceptional attention to detail as they served flavorful, artistically presented dinners and drinks.  Once again we realized why this is our favorite hotel in the Tampa area, and we look forward to visiting again soon!",

          "text": "Arrived at the airport 8 hours early after disembarking a cruise with all of our luggage. Couldn't check in for our flight until 4 hours before our flight so were looking for things to do in the airport to pass the time aside from paying for access to an airport lounge. Discovered that we could get a day pass to this Marriott with pool, gym/shower, business center access through Resort Pass for $55 per person. This included luggage storage as well. It was a short walk from inside the airport terminal to the check in at this hotel. Check in was quick, staff was pleasant and they safely stored our bags for the day. We were able to use the bathrooms and pool for the day which was great and not busy at all. The pool was nothing fancy, but it was refreshing.  We were told it was heated, but it was a bit on the chilly side. Plenty of seating and loungers in the pool area. Towels are included. It was nice to enjoy some extra sunshine on the last day of our trip. Once we were done at the pool, we went to the gym to shower. The gym was a decent size for this hotel with all the basics. There was one bathroom and one shower located inside the gym. No one was in the gym when we were there and we had the shower and bathroom to ourselves. Shower room included a large walk in shower and sink. There was a hairdryer in the shower room as well as fresh towels and washcloths. There was good quality shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the shower. Room got pretty steamy but otherwise no issues. The bathroom was large. Both areas were very clean. Check out was easy. We got our bags and it was a short walk back to the airport check in counters. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised and had a great experience in the few hours we spent here. Would definitely consider doing this again in the future. They also offer hotel rooms for the day but in limited quantity.",

I had the king deluxe room on the 19th floor.. it was VERY nice with a great view!  The lady at the front desk when i checked in ( i think her name was Sharice.. sorry if i spelled it wrong) was Amazing and Very Helpful..i ask for a fridge to be sent to my room and she made it happen quite fast my i say. The valet guys were Great especially JP and few others .. both day and night!  Everytime they saw me they spoke and joked with me as if they had knew me for years which made other ppl I’m sure question who am i lol.  Last night the weather was horrible and help an umbrella over me as i got into my car. Even when i was leaving this afternoon Abdul said “I’m sure I’ll see you soon Tee!” This was a great stay and the Staff and Valet guys made my wknd EVEN better!  I know for a fact ill be back!",

It was pretty disappointing. Especially when paying over $200 for a night. When arriving I noticed there was no fridge. Which is very surprising. I called the front office they asked if we would like to be delivered one which was nice. But when it was delivered I guess they thought the best spot was to put it right in the middle of the hall and in front of the door, and when we asked if that’s where it would be placed. They had an attitude and had to answer as in we were dumb to ask that. Not sure why you would take the fridge out of the hotel in general. Everything seems to be a bit outdated, the couch had stains all over and the shower heads seem a bit rough with ridiculous amount of sounds when turning the water on. We just tried to make the best of it. The bar was nice and the food was great and the front desk also very kind. I personally don’t see my self ever booking again here. I would definitely bring the fridges back seems like a very important part for guests staying there.",

He greeted me with a warm smile, handled my vehicle with care, and made the entire process smooth and stress-free.\n\nHakim went above and beyond to ensure everything was handled quickly while still being attentive and respectful. It’s rare to see someone take such pride in their work, and it truly made a great first impression of the hotel.\n\nThank you, Hakim, for your outstanding service — you definitely deserve 5 stars!",

Before leaving for a meeting, I informed the front desk. The gentleman I spoke with appeared concerned and assured me the issue would be resolved while I was out.\nWhen I returned later that day, the bed had been made, but the same stained sheets were still on the bed. I again notified the front desk and was told it would be corrected. After returning to my room a second time, I found the bed had once again been remade using the same stained sheets.\nAt that point, I was informed that no accommodation could be made. The employee who identified himself as a manager became dismissive, as though addressing the issue was an inconvenience rather than a legitimate concern. Given the circumstances, I chose to book another hotel for the remainder of my stay.\nI have contacted Marriott but have not yet received a response. Cleanliness is a basic expectation, particularly for a property marketed as a four-star hotel. As a Platinum Elite member who travels frequently, this experience was disappointing and not in line with the standards I have come to expect. I hope management addresses both the cleanliness and customer service issues so future guests do not have a similar experience.",

In all my years of travel, they by far had the most relaxing and refreshing bathrooms of any property I have ever stayed at.  The tilework is amazing, the stand in shower provided a luxurious feel and was very relaxing.  \n\nKeisha, Sharika, Xavier and Otis at the Front Desk were incredibly hospitable, greeting me every time I walked through the lobby, checking in on my stay, and accommodating me with any requests I had through my stay.   \n\nDuring my stay, I was visited my Monica and Dom (Bartender) who provided a personalized arrival gift which was incredibly nice and made for a pleasant evening! \n\nAnd of course…. Layla, my room attendant.  A very sweet young lady and would always smile and greet me throughout my stay.  I have also spent my years in hospitality management, including Director of Housekeeping, and have a deep appreciation for a housekeeping attendant who makes a nice tight bed… Layla’s beds are the best I have ever seen, they were like art, so nice that I felt a little guilty undoing the bed to sleep, it was a beautiful bed presentation!  \n\nGreat hotel and kudos to the several leaders I had the opportunity to interact with including Erica (Rooms), Michael (ENG) and Adam (GM).  Thank you for a Great Stay and look forward to my next trip to Houston!",

Otis offered a warm greeting, thoroughly explain amenities and the property. He was a recurring presence throughout the weekend, each time working efficiently with a bright smile and sense of humor. \n\nThe room was spacious. The design emphasized lounging over business activities, particularly the placement of a television above the desk. Anyone using that workspace would risk blocking the tv from anyone else or having the screen pressed into their forehead. \n\nI ate breakfast and dinner in the hotel restaurants. Great service and really flavorful food. \n\nGreat nights rest and limited street noise. Valet parking is pricey, but there is a garage for self-park connected via bridge. A bit of a hike. I was able to find free street parking all weekend. \n\nI’m looking forward to another opportunity to stay there.",

Seriously without him, we wouldn’t be on time with our business travel events. Thanks to Allen, he is the best!",

We stay in downtown Houston several times a year for family visits. \n\nThis was our first time staying at The Laura but it won’t be our last. The interior of the hotel has a cool art deco vibe and our room looked like it had been newly renovated with upscale decor. The Front Desk, Valet, and Restaurant had great service and the food was some of the best we’ve had in Houston!\n\nThe real star was Housekeeping. Our room was impeccably clean and honored any request for extra pillow, etc. promptly. I left some very expensive items in the room and was very concerned about this. Joshua Barklage, Housekeeping Manager, went out of his way to send them to my home in Dallas. All items arrived intact.\n\nThanks to everyone at The Laura. This is our new favorite hotel. We will be back again!",

I really appreciated the 2 free Nespresso pods and Nespresso machine so I could make coffee in my room. The room and bathroom were both very clean and sleek. The hotel is conveniently located near the metro and perfectly located in Downtown near everything. Loved the pool deck on the 5th floor with the views !",

We appreciated the thoughtful holiday touches, including Easter decorations and complimentary candy for guests. The rooftop pool area was also clean and well stocked with towels and loungers.\n\nThe only drawback was that the pool area felt a bit abandoned. There were no other guests or staff around, which may have been due to the holiday weekend.\n\nOverall, The Laura delivered the quality and attention to detail I expect from an Autograph Collection property. I would gladly stay here again on a future visit to Houston.",

The breakfast brunch was delicious with a great variety of options, and the rooftop pool had an awesome view that made it easy to relax and enjoy the city. \n\nParking valet is a bit pricey but adjacent to the Laura is an overnight parking ~$23 and there is a walkway connecting to the The Laura. \n\nYou also get Life Time gym access if you have Bonvoy Platinum and above. \n\nOverall, a great stay. I’ll definitely consider coming back!",

I arrived several hours early and checked in. got a burger at urban farmer and went and hung out at the pool, thinking they might have robes and such for guests to use like the four seasons.. but no. the pool is also not as nice as the photos look but in the winter it is nice and warm. the lobby area is well appointed and makes for a nice area to kill time. lots of various seating and deco. I saw my room ready in the app, and to their credit, the digital key worked unlike a lot of the marriotts I've stayed in. Room was quite large, but not luxury. it was just.. a big hotel room. bland furniture, run of the mill light fixtures. vents and various areas of the room were caked in dust and years old grime. there weren't any small touches or amenities that made it feel like an executive suite I paid a good bit of money for. I upgraded bc I wanted to treat myself, but unless my only goal was to have room to do cartwheels in my room, I could have stayed in a standard room. plus side, bed was comfy and the drapes made it nice and dark to sleep in.",

          "text": "My husband and I stayed for 2 nights as a couple's get away in a corner suite with a fountain view. The room was clean and comfortable but was oddly sparsely furnished. For the size of the room, I would have expected a small area to dine, perhaps a coffee table, and at least two chairs in the seating area. Staff was friendly and the food from Urban Farmer (dine in and room service) was fabulous. The service was just missing that extra spark that would have made this a five star experience. We had two people on the reservation, yet when we arrived, there was only a single robe in the closet. We called to request the robe and two blankets (no extra blankets in the room) but the gentlemen brought up only a single blanket. We ordered room service twice. The first time, they brought up a dining cart and silverware for 4 people but only one single packet of salt and pepper. The second time, they brought no dining cart (problematic because there is no dining table in the room) and only silverware for one person. We had no major problems and overall enjoyed our stay. I would definitely return for the food at Urban Farmer (fabulous brunch items, creative cocktails and outstanding steak) but the little misses by the hotel definitely made this miss the mark slightly.",

We had a king suite with plenty of room for our kids in the living room area (my son did say that the couch bed was not so comfortable, but it’s hard to expect a lot from one of those) and the view of the fountain was spectacular. The indoor pool was such a nice cherry on top since my kids love to swim and it made for a great night activity. The valets were prompt and courteous and the desk staff was lovely-shout out to Latanya who provided excellent service when we checked in, and to Samirah who was helpful when we checked out! We will most definitely stay here again when we are back in Philly!",

          "text": "Stayed here for 3 nights on business in early Dec 2025, 1 Kind Superior.  Hilton Honors Diamond status.  Hotel location is very good.  Convenient to local museums, a 3-4 block walk to local shopping and dining.  Probably closer to a 20-25 minute walk to historic parts of Philly (ie, Independence Hall, etc). I have stayed at this hotel numerous times in the past and ALWAYS had excellent stays - hotel/room quality, experience with the staff, meals, hotel facilities, valet, etc were always top notch.  While it’s still a nice hotel, its quality if starting to suffer.\n\nPros:\n\n-Valet area/arrival is always excellent.  The team they have in the valet area is the best of any hotel I have ever stayed at.  \n\n-Lobby area is really pretty.  The decor and art work give off a higher-end vibe.  It’s been the same for yeas, so it’s getting a little bit tired, but it still looks nice.  Samirah (sp?) at the front desk was friendly during my encounters with her throughout my stay.\n\n-Food/service at Urban Farmer is excellent.  I would argue one of the top hotel restaurants of any hotel I’ve stayed at.  All the food is fresh and feels homemade.  Even something as simple as an English Muffin for breakfast was a treat.  \n\n-There is a fitness center/pool/spa in the hotel basement that used to be good (more to come on that).\n\nNegatives:\n\n-No upgrade available.  Every stay I’ve had previously here, I have always received an upgrade.  I can understand if the hotel is busy.  What was odd is the front desk clerk made an excuse that Comcast was in the hotel and they always get preference on the upgrades.  Ok thanks, but I don’t really need to know the excuse. (1st world problem I know).\n\n-Parking was $72/day.  Even though I can expense it for business purposes, that price is excessive.  $50 or less is more appropriate.\n\n-Room is really showing its age.  They have the same furniture that they’ve had since it was the 4 Seasons.  That was YEARS ago, and it’s time for an update or refresh.  Furniture is OLD, and there were only 2 small drawers in the console under the TV.  Otherwise, there was no place to unpack and put your clothes (yes, I like to unpack).  \n\n-Fitness center WAS nice in the past.  Again, it’s showing its age.  They have removed several of the treadmills making it a challenge to find an open one in the morning.  Fitness equipment was in a state of disrepair (smith machine did not work).  The 1st time I used the fitness center, there were no towels.  2nd time, no cups for water.  The fitness center COULD be nice (it’s a decent sized room and plenty of space for equipment) but it is poorly cared for and it shows.  \n\nWhile the hotel is a Hilton/Curio property, the new management doesn’t seem to be focused on making a great guest experience.  There are some simple steps and investments they can make to return this hotel to a high quality status.  If you like good hotel food, stay here for Urban Farmer.  If you want a more upscale feel for a hotel, you may want to skip this hotel and look elsewhere.",

I brought florals for the tables, and the hotel decorated the room for the holidays and it looked fabulous! Lots of tasteful trees and lights and buffet pieces. \nALSO we had a retirement party in a different space at The Logan this summer and had such a good experience that we came back.",

Honestly, I really didn’t want to stay at a Hilton hotel based on past experiences with the brand of hotel. Hilton went downhill years back and I just took it off my list of preferred brands.  Well!  I’m here to say this hotel and staff were Fabulous!!  My room was beautiful and clean.  It offered updated furnishings and artwork. It was quiet believe it or not and The Logan is literally in the center of the city.  But the true highlight was ALL of the staff. From valet parking, porter services, housekeeping, front desk staff, restaurants, the food, etc. All were excellent!!  The Logan is the place to stay if you are in downtown Philly!  Hilton has made it back to my preferred hotel brands!!  Great job Hilton!",

One of the nights when we returned to the hotel the valet was nowhere to be found and we had to wait outside until he got back    The lobby bar is weak and the bartender was about as unfriendly as they come. The rooftop bar is rather uninviting as well as when you go up there every table has a reserved sign on it.  I will say that the bed was comfortable and the shower had good water pressure.  There are better options in Philly including the Sofitel where I have stayed before.",

          "title": "The most luxurious Hilton option in Philly, but is it the best?",
          "text": "It had been many, many years since I had stayed at this property, when it was still the Philadelphia Four Seasons hotel. I vaguely remember that it was a very nice hotel way back then. And I had my third-quarter Amex Biz Platinum credits that needed to be used. So I booked a recent stay here, instead of staying at either the Bellevue Hotel or the Philadelphia Hyatt Centric, my original two choices for this trip.\n\nThe Logan is still a very nice property. It is, no doubt, the most luxurious Hilton property in downtown Philadelphia. The rooms were large, the hallways were large, the desk was large, and the bathroom was large, with marble and plenty of towel hooks. I stayed at the Canopy By Hilton Philadelphia Center City earlier this year, which may be the best reviewed Hilton property in Philly. The Canopy may be \"newer\" because it was more recently renovated, but the room and hallways there there felt more crowded because they were much smaller.\n\nA few issues have prevented me from giving a five-star rating to The Logan. The TV remote control in the room simply didn't work. If I were visiting for more than one night (which I was not), I would have called the front desk to seek to have that issue fixed. Instead, I just watched what I wanted on my personal devices. A desk lamp just wouldn't turn all of the way off, so I had to unplug it from the electrical socket, which wasn't what I was hoping to do right before heading off to sleep. Also, one piece of the garment closet's opener/closer hardware was nearly pulled off the door and then left that way instead of being repaired.\n\nOn the bright side, the bed was comfy, the room was quiet, and the shower worked great. And although this is no longer a Four Seasons hotel, the building in which the hotel is located is still very nice.\n\nAs a Hilton Gold member, I opted for the $15 food credit at check-in, and then had breakfast at the Urban Farmer restaurant in the morning. I arrived for breakfast at 7 a.m. when the restaurant opened, and I had completed breakfast and charged the meal to my room (which is what you need to do to get the food credit applied) by 7:40 a.m. Later that morning, when I arrived at the front desk to check-out of my room after 11:30 a.m., nearly four hours later, the food charge for breakfast had still not yet made it to my account.\n\nAs a result, I asked the nice folks at the front desk to please make sure that my $15 food credit was applied to the breakfast charges, totaling slightly more than $30 with taxes and tip, once they posted, since I wouldn't be able to confirm that had happened once I was long gone from the hotel. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, when the breakfast charge ultimately posted, the hotel failed to apply my $15 food credit. This really made me angry.\n\nAs a result, I had to call in to the hotel's front desk a few days later, and since the whole exercise ended up taking way too much time, locating my invoice in the Hilton App (which took multiple tries), tracking down the hotel's phone number, and speaking to multiple different people at the hotel about the issue, I asked that they simply remove the entire breakfast charge from my account as a customer service resolution. The supervisor in charge agreed to do that, and the full amount of the breakfast charge was later credited back to my credit card.\n\nApparently the issue with the untimely posting of breakfast charges from the hotel's main restaurant is something that The Logan regularly experiences, and if it causes Hilton Honors members with status to lose out on their food credits, as happened to me, the hotel would end up making far more money than it cost the hotel to simply credit back the cost of my one day's breakfast.\n\nHopefully they can fix the issue and have learn their lesson here -- namely, that in the hospitality and service industries, a hotel shouldn't make it impossible for valued, repeat Hilton-brand customers to obtain the small benefits of their earned status without having to jump through multiple hoops and waste a whole bunch of time after having checked-out.\n\nBecause the hotel physically is the nicest Hilton property in Philadelphia, I am definitely planning to give this property another chance. Hopefully my next visit won't present these same issues, so that I will feel comfortable making this my Philadelphia Hilton hotel of choice into the future.",

My boyfriend and I tried to watch a movie until we saw a lone going down the tv screen. I was able to get the rooms switched but since we had to move all of our stuff we also needed balloons moved because my boyfriend surprised me with a decorated room.\nMy boyfriend went to the front desk and one of the staff told him to tell the bell boys outside and they would take care of moving the balloons for us. We were heading out to dinner and couldnt be late. My boyfriend asked the bell boy outside and he said “We dont usually take care of that” Once we got back to the room the balloons were never moved. Saturday we noticed this weird residue on the comforter and I found a ripped hole in the sheets.\nThe best birthday gift would to get my money back after not getting room service the entire weekend. For this to be the Hilton hotel, you would think this would be a good hotel to choose, but its not. Do NOT recommend.",

Apparently it was assumed we were there for the birthday party? Mind you, this is a hotel bar, not a restaurant. \n\nShady business practice. Never again.",

The best bit was a signed card from the staffs, it really made it special. It was a really wonderful stay mainly due to the staff.\n\nAffitionally the location was great, central to downtown activities.

It was typical W in many ways - lighting, lobby, upscale bar - but it also had some of the elements that I do not necessarily like especially a staff that seems to be bothered by anything you ask them. It was definitely off-putting when one of the front desk agents threatened that we would be charged $50 if we did not return the umbrella. I understand that guests should return items they borrow but that reminder can come in a friendly way, not as a threat. The valet was also never there when we drove up which was annoying. Lastly, the fitness center was small with old, well worn, and missing equipment - I wonder how much those guests were charged :)",

          "text": "Our group of eight couples booked four rooms at the W Hotel for a stay on 9/6/2025. While the hotel itself was nice and the staff was friendly, the extra fees quickly soured the experience.\n\nThe room rate was $400 ($450 with taxes and fees), which seemed inflated—likely because of the Seahawks game that weekend. Parking was another frustration. There’s no nearby self-parking, so guests are forced to use the W’s garage. When we arrived, a sandwich board outside advertised overnight parking at $15 less than the $68 listed online. Despite this, valet charged us the full $68. Since we were using Uber during our stay, we had no choice but to leave our cars with valet.\n\nThe rooms were modern and clean, but the basics were lacking. Each room only had two bath towels—fine for a solo traveler, but inconvenient for couples. The pillows were flat and worn out, and the bed felt old and saggy, leaving several of us with the sense that our feet were higher than our heads. At least one couple in our group seemed to have a newer bed, but the majority agreed that the sleeping setup was poor.\n\nThe in-room fridge was packed with overpriced drinks and snacks, leaving no space for personal use. Removing anything triggers an automatic charge. After checkout, things got worse. While driving home, I received an invoice showing two valet charges at $68 each, despite the lower rate advertised at check-in. One of the charges was eventually removed after I called, but the other remained. On top of that, we were billed a $28 “destination fee,” which supposedly covered a $14 per-person drink credit and a Ferris wheel ticket offer we received at check-in. It’s essentially a forced bar credit, whether you want it or not.\n\nIn the end, the W looks great on the surface, but guests should expect to pay at least 25% more than the listed rate once hidden charges are factored in. For the same price point, there are nicer, more transparent hotel options in Seattle.",

Bottom line: if you get a cheap rate, don't expect a 4- or 5-star experience, and don't have a car with you, it is worth considering staying here.",

Downtown Seattle is a bit of a mess with homelessness and what feels like very few tourists, so this doesn't add to the situation, but the W does feel like a lovely oasis in Downtown Seattle.\n\nUpon checking in I was warmly greeted and thanked for being an ambassador guest. I was upgraded to a Studio Suite, which is by no means a suite, but still a decent room. As an Ambassador you get free breakfast, which was $40 a day that was available in the restaurant or as room service. Breakfast was great. I ended up having room service each day, and keeping it under $40. \n\nThe room had enough space, but nothing felt as unique as the newer W's, though the views were good. The bathroom was very eh, achieving what I would expect out of a renaissance, not a luxury brand. The bath/shower were a combo and it didn't have any sexiness to it!\n\nAll-in-all if you're looking for a Bonvoy property in Seattle this one does the job well, and at a decent price point. I think it achieves all the aspects of a good premium hotel, but doesn't really stretch to be a luxury hotel. I wish it did, but also, that's not really what the Seattle market seems to be looking for.",

I have stayed at the Hilton Suites around the corner many times. I thought that I would stay at  the Westin this time. First, the hotel is in a nice part of town close to bus routes and the Red Line. The rooms are in need of a renovation. I’ve stayed at other Marriott properties the past few months and once this place gets the rooms renovated it will be nice. My only complaint about the bathroom in my room was no grab handles in the tub area. I wanted to take a bath after my race and it was challenging getting up out of the tub without getting hurt. The lobby area is nice. I ate at the breakfast buffet one morning, I wasn’t too crazy about the food selection. The pancakes were tiny and hard as a hockey puck.  They should have bigger pancakes or maybe waffles.",

          "text": "The rooms do not represent the Westin brand well. As someone who often stays at Marriott properties and looks forward to the Westin product this hotel falls short. It is my least Westin to stay at and that is because of the rooms. The hotel is dated and in need of renovation. I have stayed her many times and each room smells like it’s been dowsed in fragrant cleaners to get rid of smell. The carpets and fixtures need to go. The bathrooms are also quite tired. Water takes quite a long time to heat up in some of the rooms and the shower heads leak at their bases. Lastly the windows are thin; such that you can hear the street noise readily. Admittedly the rooms are otherwise clean and the beds comfortable.\n\nOn the other hand the hotel staff is exceptional. They are genuinely kind, courteous and professional. Each time I check in they are accommodating and seem happy to be there. Amongst the great staff, April stands out as truly exceptional. Upon checking in on a recent stay I had requested a king room. I opened my door to see two beds and heard the phone ringing. It was April, she was calling to let me know they had made a mistake and she wanted to bring up a card for a room with a king bed so I wouldn’t have to go back downstairs. That’s five stars services right there. Employees like her deserve to be recognized and valued! She is exceptional.",

I’d like to give a special shout-out to Candice at the front desk; her bright and friendly morning greetings always start my day on a high note. Whether staying on the city side or beach side, the views are stunning—I especially love the night view of  modern skyscrapers and the early morning beach view. Service requests are handled promptly, and the rooms are always spotless, leaving me with zero complaints after many stays. Plus, the location is perfect for balancing both shopping and relaxation. Highly recommended!",

          "text": "My stay at The Westin Chicago River North during the recent BRICs conference was exceptional and truly elevated the experience of attending a demanding professional event. The hotel perfectly balances high-level business functionality with top-tier personal comfort and an unbeatable location.\n​The most crucial element for a conference attendee is a restorative night's sleep, and The Westin delivered completely. Despite being in the heart of a bustling city, the rooms were incredibly quiet, providing a true sanctuary from the city noise and the day's events. This was paired with the signature Heavenly Bed mattress, which lives up to its name—it was supremely comfortable, ensuring I woke up refreshed and ready for each day's sessions.\n​Beyond the room, the hotel's location is its greatest asset. The area is phenomenal and highly walkable, making it easy to transition from professional duties to urban exploration. The hotel is situated just steps from the vibrant Chicago Riverwalk, offering immediate access to stunning views and evening strolls. It's also a pleasant walk to the beautiful shores of Lake Michigan, providing a perfect contrast to the city's energy.\n​The River North and Magnificent Mile neighborhoods boast an abundance of great eatery options within minutes of the lobby. From high-end dining and steakhouses like RPM Steak and Smith & Wollensky to casual spots and Chicago classics like The Purple Pig and Eataly, the culinary choices are endless and easily accessible on foot.\n​This Westin location is highly recommended for any professional visiting Chicago, offering tranquility, comfort, and the best of the city right outside its doors.",

My main issue is the “sewer” smell that permeates several rooms and floors.  The first room we checked into (10th floor) was so awful We literally had to wait outside… When a housekeeping manager came up, she immediately smelled it, and said that she will take care of it and move us to a different room.  Our next room, the ninth floor, was tiny!  Literally one of the smallest hotel rooms I’ve ever stayed in.\nIt smelled better, but not great.\nThe bathroom was tiny and old, The carpets are kind of dirty.  It was depressing.\nThe hallways have an old, dusty, musty, smell, with a bit of sewer mixed in.\nThere were also some issues with our bill (Including a $17.95 “coffee cart” fee!)\nFront desk was somewhat helpful, But overall, this wasn’t a great experience.\nThere are many other Marriott properties nearby that are probably a better choice.",

Not a fan of the resort fee, even if you do get half back a day to use on property. I did need to get back in my room after check out and asked the maid to open but she said she couldn’t. That was annoying but I appreciated the extra security knowing she wouldn’t just take my word for it that it was my room. It was a breeze to go to front desk and to let me back in for a moment. Location is great!",

My main issue is the “sewer” smell that permeates several rooms and floors. The first room we checked into (10th floor) was so awful We literally had to wait outside… When a housekeeping manager came up, she immediately smelled it, and said that she will take care of it and move us to a different room. Our next room, the ninth floor, was tiny! Literally one of the smallest hotel rooms I’ve ever stayed in.\nIt smelled better, but not great.\nThe bathroom was tiny and old, The carpets are kind of dirty. It was depressing.\nThe hallways have an old, dusty, musty, smell, with a bit of sewer mixed in.\nThere were also some issues with our bill (Including a $17.95 “coffee cart” fee!)\nFront desk was somewhat helpful, But overall, this wasn’t a great experience.\nThere are many other Marriott properties nearby that are probably a better choice.",

However, due to the low floor, there was hardly any natural sunlight. The bed itself was very comfortable, but the other furniture showed noticeable signs of wear and tear, making it look old.\n\nWhat was most unpleasant, however, was that the room was very close to the staff supply room. As a result, I often heard the sound of items being moved and things bumping into each other. In addition, the noise from the water pipes was very loud, waking me up several times in the middle of the night and affecting my sleep quality.\n\nOn a positive note, the hotel’s location itself was excellent.",

She was so rude. She was rushing to get rid of me. I came after a long flight. I was tired. I had a few of questions about restaurants & conference rooms etc. She was not ready to answer any of the questions. I turned around look behind me to see whether there are any other guest waiting. There was none. At the same time other girl who was very sweet & friendly to the guest she was helping. I wish I had her. \nJenieca IS NOT FIT TO WORK THE FRONT DESK.\nSome people are not made for that. She should be working back of the house. She may be racist. Or she was getting off her shift. I blame the management for hiring her. One employee could bring reputation of your establishment. I am a Hilton honors and Starwood member. \nThis bothered me so much.

          "text": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel over the weekend for a concert and initially had a pleasant experience. However, after returning home, we discovered a $350 charge for “smoking in the room.”\n\nHe does smoke cigars, but at no point did we smoke anywhere on hotel property or inside our room. We enjoyed cigars only at a downtown cigar lounge and while walking in public outdoor areas( Miles from the hotel). One unlit cigar was placed on the dresser simply so my husband could take it with him when we went out again—it was never lit indoors. There were a couple times he forgot it there while we were out so I’m sure housekeeping noticed. \n\nThe hotel claims they needed to bring in a machine to remove smoke,which is completely unfounded. If smoking had occurred, the smell would have been obvious immediately, especially to housekeeping, who cleaned our room every day during our stay (at our request!) It is unreasonable to equate the presence of an unlit cigar with actually smoking inside.\n\nWe travel frequently, are responsible adults, and have never had such an issue at any other hotel. This charge feels like an unjust and opportunistic attempt to collect additional fees without concrete evidence. Despite speaking with various different staff \n member/managers no resolution or refund was offered. For this reason, I cannot recommend this hotel. Guests should be aware that even possessing tobacco products in your room could result in unwarranted charges.",

We stayed for three nights and had a great overall experience.\n\nThe staff was warm and welcoming, and they were able to accommodate our early check-in, which we really appreciated. Our room was clean, quiet, and very comfortable—honestly, even nicer than we expected.\n\nWe booked directly through the Westin’s website, so we were aware of the destination fee, which was included in the room price. Like many big-city hotels, they charge a daily fee, but at least it could be used as a $25 daily credit at the hotel. We ended up using it at the Starbucks in the lobby for coffee and snacks each morning, which helped make it feel a little more worthwhile.\n\nWe want to give a special shoutout to the amazing woman doing housekeeping on the 25th floor (Room 2544) on Saturday, July 19th. She was incredibly kind, helpful, and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and taken care of. Her kindness stood out, and we hope she gets to see this—she truly made a difference in our stay!\n\nOne unexpected bonus: being on the 25th floor, we had a great view of the Navy Pier fireworks right from our room. It was a fun surprise and added to the experience.\n\nIf we had to mention one small (and lighthearted) complaint, it’s that we didn’t get any Garrett’s popcorn in the room. We’re not sure if it was ever promised, but if anyone at the Westin feels like sending some our way, we definitely wouldn’t say no!\n\nAll in all, we had a great time and would absolutely stay here again. Highly recommend if you're coming to Chicago",

It was easy to use public transit (download the Ventra app) and we used Uber/Lyft a few times. If you are a light sleeper, it’s helpful to know there are LOTS of sirens and unending honking at the corner of Michigan/Delaware. We got used to it and Chicago is a noisy city, but our city view was great from our room on the 7th floor. It’s across the street from the 100 story John Hancock building. \nI pre-paid for the breakfast everyday and was glad I did. It’s a waiter sit down meal and is a buffet on the weekends. The vouchers include tip as well but our server was phenomenal so I gave him a great tip on the last day. \nI would recommend this hotel. The one thing that caught me off guard was the $35 daily destination fee that they charge you when you check out. They did tell me about it at check in but I wasn’t sure if that was already included in the price I had paid to rent my room. It is not. They have ways you can try to use some of that money (like $15/day for food if you charge to your room..but it is not cumulative) and some nearby attractions like the sports museum, architectural museum etc. I would rather not have that be a mandatory fee. Other than that, it was a comfortable stay in a great location.",

Hotel is very average - there was nothing wildly amazing, but also nothing horrible.  Highly suggest Westin put some money into soft renovations and if so, they would have an exceptional hotel in downtown.  \n\nAs for HSH’s list:\n\nPro’s:\n- Super cozy bed\n- Loved little couch in room - gave some needed extra storage space for backpack, carry on bag, etc.\n- Iron in the room was fantastic!  I am a terrible ironer and whatever iron this was made it very simple to get wrinkles out\n- Bagel, egg, cheese at the fake Starbucks in the lobby was delicious\n\nCon’s:\n- Shower had mold\n- Closet smelled funky.  So funky that I had to keep the closet door open so my clothes wouldn’t smell\n\nRecommendations:\n- Opportunity for housekeeping to deep clean bathrooms\n- Lobby and guest room renovation would make this hotel shine again\n\nI would definitely stay here again if I needed to stay downtown and would not be in my room 24/7.  Good choice for transient and business guests.",

I don't know what they did but I knew something was wrong when we checked into the room because the toilet had a wedge shoved underneath it because it was unstable. Why did they not fix it before we got into the room? The next morning the floor was soaking wet because something was leaking from whatever they did. We also ran out of body wash in the shower. Obviously, they don't check when they clean the room. In the bar they charge $2 for ice in your cocktail. What a joke. The only good thing of our stay was a server named Mike in the restaurant.

I also typically have great luck with Westins, and have never had a bad stay. Unfortunately, the condition of the room has made my stay so far less comfortable than expected.\n\nThe room itself feels very dated and worn. The chair upholstery is peeling and damaged, the carpet has visible burn marks, and there are multiple areas of peeling wallpaper. The popcorn ceilings and overall finishes make the room feel overdue for renovation. No mini fridge to store personal items, only a mini bar.\n\nThe bathroom is exceptionally small, and the electrical outlets have had trouble with my hair dryer, and lighting is terrible. These issues are especially challenging given that I’m here for a multi-day business stay and need a functional, comfortable space.\n\nI’m disappointed, as I expected a much higher standard for a hotel catering to business travelers. I’m here for the next four nights, hoping this room is a one off and the hotel can move me.",

Had to go down to the lobby twice because I couldn’t get a hold of anybody on the phone using the service express button. The indoor pool wasn’t even warm enough to put my feet in. The self parking for one night was still $60. I can’t even imagine what the valet would cost. I spent $72 on a meal at the downstairs bar and I’ve had better food at Subway. I then was moved to a new room that smelled like someone smoked cigarettes in it. Then moved to a third room where I had to move the bed and box spring to reach an outlet. I thought this hotel would be a good experience based off of other reviews. The staff was amazing however. Very kind and made the situation right. That’s the only reason I give it 3 stars.",

Check-in was painless, there was never a wait for the elevators, and our room on the 37th floor was large and had a great view.\nBonvoy elite members also get a free grande coffee at the Starbucks within the lobby, which is nice after an evening of revelry.",

I had a weird experience of returning to my room to find that the shower gel that had been mounted to the shower wall had been removed. I had already been there for 5 days and wasn't checking out until the following Monday.\nThe food at Relish is very good. I had the Waygu Smash Burger (Twice). 5⭐️.\nThis hotel is very close to the Seattle Convention Center and the Pike Place Market, which I highly recommend.\nThe most problematic issue was the elevators in the North Tower. Each tower has 4 elevators. By Wednesday, only 2 of 4 elevators in the North Towers were working, and it took 15 to 40 minutes for the 2 working  elevators to circle back to my floor, with enough room for the rest of us to enter. Even by Sunday, when most of our nearly 900 delegates had checked out, the elevators were still slow.",

Surprised with such a big hotel with so many rooms.

          "text": "This is a fairly typical American downtown chain hotel where you know what you are getting. A nice lobby, outdated rooms, and a feeling that you are just making up the numbers on a factory conveyer belt. The reception staff were devoid of any warmth and the person I spoke to was regurgitating memorized lines while checking me in. When I asked about breakfast options, he seemed totally thrown off, gave me an odd stare, and then just pointed in a generic direction with a “you can eat there if you like”.\n\nThe property clearly has little incentive to update their rooms due to a steady supply of corporate travellers. The rooms are big but very dated. The bathroom had a heavily stained tub accompanied by an unhygienic cloth curtain. There is no shower cubicle. Housekeeping is not automatically provided and needs to be requested (for “environmental reasons” obviously, nothing to do with cost cutting). Having requested this, housekeeping did their best to keep their services environmentally friendly by not actually cleaning the room. I had the same bar of disintegrating soap next to my sink for 5 days which was never replaced. It was very obvious that the bathroom and bedroom surfaces had not been wiped even once during my stay. The only thing they appeared to do was replace the used towels.\n\nThe gym was very cramped and crowded, even at 6am. There was absolutely no space to walk around. Frankly, it looks like the gym was just crowbarred into a disused corner so the property could list the gym as an amenity. If you are serious about your daily gym workouts, do not stay at this hotel.\n\nThere is one restaurant at the hotel: Relish Burger Bistro. What is not made clear when you check-in is that this restaurant offers a very good breakfast buffet. There is a generic menu at the entrance so it is not immediately obvious that a breakfast buffet is available. The staff at Relish are exceedingly courteous and seem to be operating independently to the hotel staff. \n\nThe hotel lobby is expansive and has a great atmosphere in the evenings once the bar fills up. \n\nThe location of the property is fantastic, very central, and the surrounding area feels safe. Pike Place, South Lake Union, and the Central Business District are all within walking distance.\n\nOverall, quite a mixed experience. Because I did not spend much time in the room, I was not too bothered about its general state. But I guess that is exactly what the hotel relies on. There was no additional benefit to being a Gold Elite member either.",

We were stuck on hold for an hour only to get an outsourced call center, which was not helpful. Oh well, we decided to make it work and stay. \n\nWe arrived at the hotel around 11:30 a.m. and attempted to check in or, at worst, leave our luggage to go out into the city. To our surprise, we were able to, which we were very appreciative of. The front desk agent that helped us was very helpful and nice. \n\nAfter receiving our keys and making it up to our room, we were surprised to see it was not the room we had booked. We received a room with two full-sized beds vs. the one king bed. Due to how busy the front desk was and how long the initial wait took, we decided to just keep the room as we had somewhere we had to be at 1. We were very disappointed that we did not receive the room that we booked. This was our first time staying at a Westin property. The room itself was an average hotel room and not exactly what I’d expect when I hear “Westin”. Our tv did not work. We attempted to unplug and look at the power strip, but we gave up and went to bed. The bed was pretty comfortable, and I enjoyed the pillows. The bathroom was a standard hotel bathroom. \n\nOverall, the total experience from before we arrived, trying to get customer service to having our room messed up with the rooms themselves being an average room at best, led to a 2-star review.",

I think we were on the 10th floor of the north tower.  The signage said ice machine this way. We circled the floor and found no ice machines. We asked the maid who directed us to the 13th floor. Actually, Ice machines are on odd floors.

It does have that MCM feel and I appreciated the look of the lobby. We got a complimentary upgrade so we caught a bit of a water view. The night view with the city lights was a total treat. And the beds were dreamy! Of course the location cannot be beat. Which was good considering a room cost us $500 for one night. On the less than spectacular end of things, my kids went to the pool and said the water smelled horrible - so bad that they didn't even really want to swim in it. And the elevator situation is tragic. Lots of waiting for elevators. The elevators feel shaky and worrisome. Even though there were open stations at the check in desk they weren't staffed and there was a decent line to get checked in. On a Saturday, at 4:15. You would think there would be other staffing decisions made. The person who checked us in was an absolute sweetheart though so at the end of the day I had a great experience with the staff when I got to the checkout counter. There is no such thing as a perfect hotel and the Westin is a very good hotel.",

Food at the hotel was very good (pizza and salad) and excellent service with storing our luggage until our shuttle ride. There was a mix up in a charge for the internet and they corrected it immediately. All in all a very good experience.

Housekeeping was consistent and well done, with bottled water replenished daily.\n\nDespite the hotel being full, the Wi-Fi worked well and the elevators were fast, which made a big difference. Room service on my first night was fresh and prompt. The location was ideal for walking to nearby event venues.\n\nThe only real miss was the lobby-level bar and coffee shop. They were clearly not staffed for the full hotel and unable to handle the volume. I gave up on getting morning coffee or an evening drink at the hotel and found better options nearby.\n\nOverall, the stay met my expectations for a Westin, but the hotel should consider better ways for its amenities to accommodate a full hotel.",

Instead, they give you a one-page paper with instructions. When you read this instruction paper you find no clarification about breakfast. Instead, the paper explains where the restaurant is allocated and the time of opening.\n1.3\tWith all this confusion in my mind on my first stay, I woke up in the morning and went to the restaurant to have my breakfast. There was a queue and a couple of barristers taking orders and I saw most people paying in cash, regardless of whether they were staying in the hotel or not. As I was staying in the hotel, I asked if I could have breakfast. The reply was, if I want a buffet, I have to pay $39.00 + service total of over $45.00. Other than buffet, I have to pay as I use like any passing by customer.\n1.4\tIn hotel restaurants and any bars, they don’t use \"Tap in\" payment. Instead, they preferred in cash or taking your payment card and coming back with paper and pan to make you sign in a very backward way.\n2)\t4-Star Hotel standard\nAs worldwide, a 4-star hotel should also receive a personalised welcome, perhaps with fresh flowers or a small gift, and enjoy a turndown service, regarding complimentary beverages. Bottled water, tea, and coffee are standard offerings in 4-star hotels, but in the Westin Seattle hotel\n2.1 At check-in, you may be offered a 500mil bottle of water.\n2.2 When you get in the room, you find a full fridge with a different kind of drink which is chargeable. It is reasonably acceptable. On the top of the fridge there is a table and on that table there are diferent kind of Beverages, almost all of them chargeable.\nThe trickiest and deliberately planted items are beside those beverages. One bottle of water and a bottle of wine also chargeable.\nAs explained above, except for the items in the refrigerator, the rest are very confusing and easy to trick the customer and to use them without understanding that they are chargeable. \nIn this regards the Westin Seatle hotel, under standard and use extrmly gridy system to get rip-off his coustomers.",

And charged us destination fee.\n\nWestin already has a spoilt reputation and won’t go here again.\n\nTo check out it took us 45 mins and we had to pay our driver extra to wait or we would have missed our cruise. It’s like they are paying us to stay there for free.\n\nThe manager on escalation was too pompous to come and resolve, sitting in his office. He told Jacob that he is busy and asked us to write to him. Thinking guests are jobless!!\n\nDon’t spoil your holiday choosing them, there are many other good hotels in vicinity.",

          "text": "The Westin hotel is a nice high quality hotel that looks great on first glance, but the more you dive in it doesn’t look at great. In this review I will talk about many different parts of the hotel, good and bad.\n\nFirst impressions: walking in the hotel is so beautiful with great rugs and flavored water and complimentary fruit. The windows and lookout on a hill is so beautiful.\n\nChecking in: checking in is relatively easy, with the service seeming quite nice to start.\n\nGetting to the room: the elevator is very nice, and the halls are very easy to navigate, unlike some other hotels.\n\nThe room: the rooms are okay, with the bathrooms being the highlight. But the walls and overall mood is nice, but some closer issues remain that I will state later.\n\nNight and service: these are my main issues. At night, there were multiple people screaming and slamming doors; ranging from 9 pm-4 in the morning! I called telling them what happened, and they said they will take care of it. The same night it kept happening and I called been saying what happened and they said that there is “nothing they can do about it” and it retained for the rest of my weeks vacation I called in multiple times kept saying why there’s nothing that they can do about it and they said that“Nothing was actually happening “ Which rightfully made me very upset because it literally was.\n\nOverall: the Westin is a nice hotel with overall nice rooms and atmosphere and good room service not service for complaints and nice pool and great burgers. Some issues though hold this back from being a great hotel.",

The rooms are immaculate, and the prices are usually shockingly low for this high-quality brand. Highly highly recommend",

The vanity in my bathroom was cracked and there was pubic hair in the tub and toilet which were not mine because I hadn't used the bathroom.  So much dust on the wall and mop boards I cleaned it myself. No microwave in the room so I dont know where they expect you to heat up left overs, oh wait, they dont, they want you to go down into their overpriced shoddy hotel restaurant.  And the beautiful comfy robe they provide for you to relax in after a long day, I wouldn't put that robe in to line my animals cage its so terribly scratchy and uncomfortable.   Staff was snotty and rude.  I asked a question and they looked at me like I was beneath them.  Much rather stay at a cheaper hotel with better amenities and service.  Not worth the price!!!",

          "text": "For a Westin, this hotel really leaves much to be desired.  There are a few good things: the beds are very comfy (though they are doubles, not queens).  The buffet breakfast was like a typical hotel buffet that you’d find most places (bacon, sausage, French toast, eggs, toast, oatmeal + toppings), but a bit elevated.  The fresh fruit was really nice, and the staff were attentive and friendly.  However, the rooms are cramped and pretty old.  The bathroom has definite signs of many, many years of poor ventilation (rusty door hinges and sprinkler heads, mildew in the shower grout), and there is a water stain in the ceiling of the  bedroom as well.  Maintenance is lacking as well: when we first arrived in our room after a long day of travel, the deadbolt didn’t work.  The front desk said that they’d have an engineer take a look, but neglected to tell me that it would be the next day.  So after waiting a long time and having no one show up, I called again and they were able to find someone to come and fix it so that I could finally go to bed feeling secure.  The next day, the toilet lever detached from the tank mechanism.  I tried to just put it together again myself, but it kept detaching, so I asked the front desk to send someone to fix it while I was out.  6 hours later I was back and it still wasn’t fixed.  Also, there’s no moisturizing cream, and the pumps for shampoo, etc in the shower are mounted way too high for this 5’1” person!",

I’m a loyal Marriott customer but would never stay here again. Service at this hotel was really bad. I blame management because the hotel is under staffed and the minimal staff they have are poorly trained.\n\nFront desk staff was rude and not at all accommodating. We missed the beginning of the service because of them even though I checked in 24 hours early and requested a check-in time of 1:30. \n\nWe didn’t get to eat breakfast because the restaurant was under staffed and the line for the buffet seating was out the door. \n\nThe room was not in great shape - bathroom drains clogged, bathroom vent fan inoperable, desk AC outlets inoperable, etc.\n\nOverall, the hotel is poorly managed. The staff is not to blame - they are doing the best they can with the limited resources provided.",

Although the pool and gym were well kept, the singular shower on that level was locked and the restroom was not clean and it did not have toilet paper. \n\nWhen we told staff about this, I couldn’t believe the words that came out of this man’s mouth. He said “There shouldn’t be a bathroom there.” Puzzled, I asked, “So if I need to use the restroom while I’m exercising or swimming, where do I go?”  He replied bluntly, “You have to come upstairs.” He apologized but said once again that there shouldn’t be a restroom there. I responded that there should be some sign indicating that. I was also dumbfounded because all hotels and resorts I’ve been to have a shower and restroom open, available, and right next to the gym/fitness center and pool! Perhaps it was just his choice of words, but I found that to be very wrong, such an incorrect way of handling the situation. Hopefully the right changes will be made and that guests can have access to a restroom while they are working out or swimming or they should shut down the pool and fitness center.",

So I would give it higher marks on curb appeal. First night we needed to change our room because of smell coming from bathroom.  The front desk was very helpful and apologetic.  We went to the lounge area for a drink and honestly we taken aback when we got our bill…$19 for a plain mixed drink - no top shelf liquor just a rum and Diet Coke…wow!  Like being at a nice high end resort hotel in Boston or on an island!   Buyer be ware! We had breakfast package but buffet seems to be about $25-$$30 pp, nothing special about it.   They definitely need to work on the restaurant.  We opted to park our car in a side parking lot as the garage was honestly in rough condition.  I am a loyal Marriott member and was disappointed in this one!   We did love the “heavenly bed” which was the highlight of this stay.\n\nMaybe someday they will spend some money and make this into a beautiful place to stay.",

If somebody was sitting on the toilet, the bathroom door swings open directly into their knees. \n\nMaking matters worse, this week they cut services to the restaurant which has guests infuriated.  The morning buffet has been removed entirely, replaced strictly with table service. The overpriced menu aside, the restaurant only had one waitress for 60 guests.

She also returned my bellhop cart to the right place.I could tell that she was really trying. I think this place is amazing. It is also cold. Not the room, but all of the common spaces… It’s all windows… Not a great idea for New England.",

The fitness center is okay.  The two treadmills I tried to use did not work, but there are probably a dozen various cardio machines. The pool is tiny but warm.   There is no lounge floor.  There was no mini bar in the junior suite we stayed in.  Room service and all food service ends before 10 pm.  The $25 breakfast buffet was on par with a typical complimentary Residence Inn breakfast. There didn't appear to be enough staff to handle a la carte breakfast orders.  Overall, it is a nice, clean hotel, but not a top-tier Westin in terms of services and the price charged per room.",

          "text": "Hotel staff never told us about the parking per night charges, not when we checked in, not when we checked out. When we checked in late the first night, the front desk clerk asked if we already parked our car and even said he doesn't need to take down our license plate. We have stayed there before and we were not charged for parking, despite being told they've had this policy for a long time. I asked the front desk twice (2 different people) when we checked out whether we need to sign anything and if our bill was all settled. They said yes, because we prepaid our stay through American Express Travel so we don't owe anything. We didn't sign anything (despite me asking) to indicate that we didn't owe anything upon check-out. \n\nA few days later, even the $100 temporary incidental hold they placed on my card came off. Then, a week later, I got a notification from American Express that my card got charged $40. I thought it was a mistake/fraudulent charge so I contacted AE and they said I needed to contact the hotel to have them take it off if it's a mistake. I contact the hotel, spoke to a guy named Rodney at the front desk, I asked why I just got charged $40 when I'm nowhere near the hotel. He then asked me if we parked our car during our stay and said that's what the charge was for. I said, no one told us about the parking fee, didn't take down our license plate and somehow a week later, someone just remembered that we parked our car? He said, \"yeah, it's on our website\". He just kept repeating that and said that he can't take the charge off, whether I authorized it or not. While we were talking, he proceeds to generate a receipt for it and emails it to me. On it, there was my signature, FORGED! I contact AE and they said it needs to show up on my bill so they can help me dispute it. I contact the hotel back, spoke to Rodney again at \"guest services\", and told him I didn't authorize this charge, no one informed us (and we would have happily paid the bill had they said something during check in or check out), AND that they forged my signature in order to get the charge approved! When I said that, he replied in a very condescending voice, \"Oh, no! Really?\" I can hear the smirk on his face. I told him it's a crime to forge someone's signature, he was like, \"well, we can't take the charge off\" and proceeds to hang up on me while I was still talking. Not once, did he apologize for not communicating properly or for the inconvenience he/they caused or for FORGING my signature (it was likely him because his name is on the receipt as the one who generated the charge), and was rude and condescending the entire time! AE has flagged the charge and will dispute it due to \"fraud\" and will block this merchant from being able to charge anything to my card! \n\nIn the meantime, we will NEVER stay there again! These people have no integrity, are completely unprofessional, and to top it off, they don't clean the room when they come in to do housekeeping! We booked a room for 3 people and they give us 1 bottle of water. The coffee supply was for 2 people. These aren't even that important. The most egregious thing is they will forge your signature to authorize a charge to your card without your permission! Do you trust to do business with these people??? DON'T STAY AT THE WESTIN IN WALTHAM, BOSTON!",

It took all week for them to return the charge to my card. In speaking with other coworkers, warning them to check their accounts, they were also charged various amounts - one person was charged $1600!\n\nNext, the Wi-Fi was terrible. I was unable to take calls via zoom with my camera on because the network was super unstable. \n\nFinally, we ate at the hotel restaurant for dinner and it took an hour to get a cocktail drink and then an additional hour to receive our food, which had to be recooked because it was cold. And no, it was not busy. \n\nI’m not sure I’ll be staying at this Westin again.",
